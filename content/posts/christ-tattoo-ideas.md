The brainstroming phenomenon is a term used to describe a mental state in which a person has high levels of focus and concentration on one thing. Brainstroming can be described as being in a "zombie zone." This state can be caused by a variety of reasons such as stress, boredom, or fatigue. When the mind is focused on just one thing, it is difficult to move on from that focus.

How to do brainstroming effectively
Picture a room full of people, all focused on one task. They are all working together towards a common goal. This is the brainstroming effect, or the power of team work.
The brainstroming effect works because people's brains are tuned to multi-tasking. When we're focusing on one task, our attention span is limited and it takes longer for our brain to process information. This can lead to confusion and a lack of focus.

However, if we switch our focus away from the task at hand, our brains are more likely to revert back to their normal processing speed and be more productive once again. In fact, science has found that when we switch our focus away from a task for just a few seconds, the speed of our brainstems activity decreases by 50%.

The creative process: How does one go about creating something new?
Creativity is a process that some people enjoy and others find difficult. The creative process can be broken down into four main categories: 1) Brainstorming 2) Idea generation 3) Implementation 4) Delivery. In order to be creative, one must have an idea and be able to come up with creative ways to express that idea. Additionally, one must have the courage to take risks in order to create something new. Lastly, creativity can only come from within.
