Types of creativity: Presentation, Idea, Solution, Legacy
Creativity is a vast and ever-changing field. The following are three types of creativity: presentation, idea, and solution. Presentation creativity is the ability to create an effective and catchy presentation that stands out from the competition. Idea creativity is the invention of new solutions to problems that have been faced before. Solution creativity comes in handy when there is no existing solution that can be found. It is the creative rendering of a problem into a solved entity. Legacy creativity is the retention of your ideas after they are finished, whether it be for future use or just to keep them safe and stored away in your brain for future reference.

How can people start thinking about new ideas?
Most people think of ideas when they are brainstorming, but there are other ways to come up with new ideas. Sometimes all you need is a new perspective. Here are three tips to help you get started: 
1. Give yourself time: Sometimes the best way to come up with new ideas is to allow yourself time to think about them. Don’t try to come up with any ideas in an instant. Take your time and consider everything that you have said before coming up with a new idea. 

2. Be open-minded: Once you have considered some potential ideas, it’s important that you be open-minded about them. If something doesn’t sound right or feels too farfetched, don’t be afraid to change your mind after thinking about it more. Remember that every idea has at least one potential application.
