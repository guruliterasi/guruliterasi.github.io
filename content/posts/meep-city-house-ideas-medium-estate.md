The history of creative art
Creative art has been around since the dawn of time. cave paintings and sculptures are some of the earliest examples of creative art. Throughout history, creative art has been used as a form of expression. It wasn’t until the Renaissance that artists began to sign their work.
During the Renaissance, creativity was seen as a God-given talent. This period was marked by great advances in art, literature, and music. Artists such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were able to express their ideas and emotions through their artwork. The Renaissance was a time of great change and creativity.

In the 20th century, creative art took on many different forms. Abstract expressionism, pop art, and minimalism were all new movements that challenged traditional ideas about art. Today, there are no rules when it comes to creating art.
