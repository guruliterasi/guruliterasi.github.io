The 5 Big Ideas of Creativity
Creativity is an important concept in our lives. It can be used to come up with new ideas, or to find solutions to problems. Here are five big ideas of creativity: 1. One can be creative when they are thinking out loud – this means that they are not just focusing on one thing. They are brainstorming and working on multiple ideas simultaneously. This is an excellent way to get inspired and come up with new ideas. 2. One can be creative when they are working alone – this means that they have complete freedom and control over their work space. They can work on whatever they want, and no one else is interfering or checking them out. This can be a great way to come up with unique and innovative ideas. 3. One can be creative when they are working with others – this means that they are collaborating with other people throughout the entire process of creating something.

Where to find them: Look around you
Invention ideas are everywhere. Look around your home, office, or neighborhood and you’ll find countless potential inventions just waiting to be created. Here are a few tips on where to find invention ideas:
Start by looking at everyday items and thinking about how they could be improved. For example, does your favorite coffee mug have a design flaw that makes it difficult to hold? Could your toothbrush be more ergonomic?

Pay attention to problems you encounter in your daily life. Is there an annoying task that you wish there was a machine to do for you? Is there a product that you can’t find that would make your life easier?

Keep a notebook with you and jot down any ideas that come to mind, no matter how small or silly they may seem. You never know when inspiration will strike!

Ideas for Bigger Ideas: What are some ideas for bigger ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are plenty of them out there. And while all of them have potential to make a real impact, some may be more achievable than others. Here are some ideas for bigger ideas:
1. Make the world a better place through innovation. This is something that has been talked about for years and it's still not happening as fast as people need it to. Innovation can come from anything – from improving education to developing new ways of manufacturing products.

2. Create more jobs in the United States. The country is struggling right now and there are too many people without good jobs.

Some examples include creating new businesses or increasing the number of job opportunities at existing businesses.

3. Save the environment.
