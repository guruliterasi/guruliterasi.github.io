2020: The year of the moon
Given that the moon is a natural satellite of Earth, it has been speculated for many years what could happen if human beings were to explore and land on the moon. And while 2020 is not necessarily the year that such a mission would be attempted, there are plenty of ideas out there for when such an endeavor could take place. Here are four examples: 
The first idea involves space travel to the moon by using a small spacecraft called Artemis. This spacecraft would be able to dock with a Russian Luna-15 spacecraft and release its astronauts in order to study the moon's surface. 
Another idea involves exploring space stations on the moon. These stations would provide research resources and rotating crews that could also conduct tasks like mining or robotic excavation. 
Lastly, we have another idea involving sending humans back down to the moon in an effort to change certain aspects of its environment.
