Conclusion
Innovation is not a new concept. It has been around since the beginning of time. However, it has only recently become a buzzword in the business world.
Innovation is the process of taking an idea and turning it into a reality. It is about creating something new or improving upon something that already exists. Innovation can be big or small. It can be something as simple as a new way to make a cup of coffee or as complex as developing a new form of renewable energy.

There are four main types of innovation: product, process, business model, and social. Product innovation is about creating new products or improving upon existing ones. Process innovation is about improving the way things are done. Business model innovation is about changing the way businesses operate. Social innovation is about solving social problems in new and innovative ways.

The creative process
The creative process is a journey that can be both exciting and challenging. It is a process that requires both left brain and right brain thinking. The left brain is responsible for logical, linear, and sequential thinking. The right brain is responsible for more creative, intuitive, and nonlinear thinking.
The creative process often begins with an idea or a problem that needs to be solved. The first step is to gather information about the problem or the challenge at hand. Once the information has been gathered, it is time to start generating ideas. This is where the left brain and the right brain need to work together. The left brain will come up with logical solutions while the right brain will come up with more creative solutions.

Once ideas have been generated, it is time to start narrowing down the options. This step requires both critical thinking and creativity.

The Benefits of New Ideas: What do they offer?
The benefits of new ideas are vast and range from more efficient ways to do things to new and innovative products that can change the way people live. Here are a few examples: 
1. New ideas can help you save time and money. If you can think of a way to make your work or home easier, you may be able to save time and money on tasks that you previously would have had to spend hours completing. 
2. New ideas can improve your creativity. When you come up with new ideas, it can be difficult not to come up with something that is both good and useful. By taking some time for yourself to come up with new ideas, you will be more likely to find something onerous or simply useless as well as something valuable that you could implement into your life immediately. 
3. New ideas can make life easier.
