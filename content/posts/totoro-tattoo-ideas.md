Creative juices: How creativity flows through our veins
Creativity is one of the most powerful forces in our lives. It can help us see things in a new way, inspire us to create, and connect with others. But just how creativity flows through our veins? And what role does it play in our lives?
According to a study by University of Edinburgh researchers, creativity is passed down from parents to children through their blood pressure levels. When the parents had high blood pressure levels, they were more creative than when they had low blood pressure levels. This finding suggests that creativity is a natural part of human nature and can be passed down through the generations.

Other studies have also shown that creativity is connected with stress levels. If people are under stress, they are less creative than if they are not under stress. This suggests that stress can influence how creative we become.

Conclusion: Some tips for staying creative.
Creativity is key to a successful life. With the right tools, creativity can be unleashed to achieve anything you set your mind to. Here are a few tips to help you stay creative: 1. Take time for yourself – if you don’t have time for creativity, it won’t flow out of you. Slow down and allow yourself some time for yourself so that you can come back with fresh ideas. 2. Get organized – once you have an idea, try to organize it so that it feels like a project instead of something that just needs to be done. This will help keep your brain active and focused on the task at hand. 3. Be open to feedback – negative or positive feedback will help you develop new ideas and come up with new ways of thinking about things.
