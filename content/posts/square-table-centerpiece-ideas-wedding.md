Nice ideas are a great way to make a great product. By using nice ideas, you can increase the chances of success for your project. Here are five tips to help you use nice ideas to create a successful product:
1. Start with common problems and solutions. When you start with a problem or solution, you’re more likely to find common ground and develop an idea that everybody can understand.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at an old problem to taking the opposite approach to an existing idea and seeing what happens. Sometimes these ideas can come from simply thinking about something different and seeing what comes out. There are so many creative ideas out there it's hard to know where to start! Here are a few examples: 
1. Try a new perspective on an old problem. When you look at something from a different angle, often the solution is obvious but you may not have thought of it before. This is where creativity comes in – trying things that others may have thought of as impossible or not worth trying. 
2. Make something that no one has ever done before. Something that is different but also traditional or familiar enough so people can feel comfortable with using it.
