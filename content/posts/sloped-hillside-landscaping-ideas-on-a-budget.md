Types of innovation
There are many types of innovation, each with its own benefits and drawbacks. To get a better understanding of what types of innovation are available, it can be helpful to look at some examples. 
Innovation can come in the form of new products or services, new methods for doing something, or a change in how things are done. There are many different types of innovation available, so it is important to find what best suits your needs and business goals. 

Some benefits of innovation include improving customer service and satisfaction, creating new markets for products or services, expanding the reach of an existing product or service, and increasing productivity. However, there are also risks associated with any type of innovation. For example, if a company over-promises or under-delivers on their new product or service, this could harm their reputation and cause customers to abandon them.

Brainstorming Methods: Different ways to brainstorm invention ideas.
1. When it comes to brainstorming invention ideas, there are a variety of different methods you can use.
2. One popular method is called "brainstorming by association." This involves coming up with ideas by associating them with other words or concepts.
3. Another common method is called "freewriting." This involves simply writing down whatever comes to mind, without worrying about whether it makes sense or not.
4. If you're having trouble getting started, try brainstorming with a group of friends or colleagues. You may be surprised at how quickly the ideas start flowing when you're working with others.
5. Whatever method you choose, the important thing is to keep the ideas flowing. Don't worry about whether they're good or bad at first, just get them down on paper (or in a computer file). You can always edit them later.

The art of collaboration: How do you work best with others to come up with creative ideas?
Collaboration is one of the most important aspects of any creative project. It allows for different ideas to be put together and can result in improved results. There are a few things to keep in mind when working with others, though, to make the most out of collaboration: 
1. Be willing to give up your own ideas - Collaborators need to be willing to take risks and put their own opinion aside if they want C-level projects to succeed. This doesn't always mean that everyone will like what comes out of it, but it's essential that everyone is on board with the project before anything gets started.

2. Be open to feedback - Collaborators need to be willing to give constructive feedback if they want their work to improve or simply be heard.
