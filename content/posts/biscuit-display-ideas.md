Introduce the topic of invention ideas
Most people never think about invention ideas until they see a commercial for a new product on television. Even then, the average person rarely stops to think about how that product was created or what it took to bring it to market. The process of invention is one that takes a lot of time, energy and dedication. Inventors are some of the most creative people in the world. They look at the world around them and see problems that need to be solved.
Invention ideas can come from anywhere. Sometimes inventors are inspired by nature, other times they see a problem and work to find a solution. There are also times when an inventor comes up with an idea for a product that is completely new and unique. No matter where the idea comes from, all inventions start with an idea.

The first step in turning an idea into an invention is doing some research.

The environment: How will we handle the increasing amount of pollution?
In an effort to save the planet, many people are trying to devise new ways of living that do not rely on traditional methods of production. One such way is using green technology. 
One idea that has been gaining attention is the use of clean energy sources like solar and wind power. These sources provide clean energy that can be used to produce electricity without causing any pollution. 

It is important to note that these types of technologies are still in their development and will likely have a longer timeline before they are fully implemented on a large scale. However, if done correctly, these types of technologies could help us avoid some of the biggest pollutants on Earth.

Creative ways to use creativity in your day-to-day life
Creativity is a key part of life and can be used to come up with new ideas, solve problems, and achieve goals. Here are some creative ways to use creativity in your day-to-day life:
1. Get inspired by nature: Look at pictures of natural disasters or scenes from around the world and think of creative ways you could incorporate them into your home or workspace. This can be a great way to bond with nature and get lost in the moment.
2. Try something new: When you have a blank canvas, try painting or sculpting without any preconceptions about what you will end up with. Just go for it! This can help you start thinking outside the box and come up with new ideas that might not have been considered before.
3. Get organized: When it comes to creativity, order is key.
