How can you use brainstroming in your life?
Ever since the dawn of time, people have used their minds to improve their lives. Whether it was through mental arithmetic or logical thinking, humans have found ways to make use of their cognitive skills for good. In today's world, brainstroming is more than just a way to think better; it's an essential part of any successful life. Here are five ways you can use brainstroming in your everyday life:

The importance of creativity in education
Since the dawn of time, creativity has been an integral part of human existence. It is what has allowed us to survive and thrive as a species. Today, more than ever, creativity is essential for success in all aspects of life.
In education, creativity is just as important as anything else. It allows students to think outside the box, to find new and innovative solutions to problems, and to express themselves in unique ways.

Unfortunately, creativity is often stifled in traditional educational settings. Too much emphasis is placed on conformity and rote learning, instead of encouraging students to explore their own creative potential. This needs to change if we want our children to be successful in an increasingly competitive world.
