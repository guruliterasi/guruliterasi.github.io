Prototype creation
Inventors often have a great idea for a product or invention, but don't know how to create a prototype. There are many ways to create prototypes, and the best method depends on the type of product or invention. Here are some tips for creating prototypes:
If you have an idea for a physical product, the best way to create a prototype is to find someone who can help you build it. This could be a friend or family member who is good with tools, or you could hire a professional. Once you have your prototype, you can show it to potential investors or manufacturers to get feedback and interest in your product.

If your invention is more of an intangible concept, such as a new app or software program, you can create a prototype yourself using basic coding language. This will give you a chance to test out your idea and see if it's feasible.

Ever since the dawn of time, people have used their minds to improve their lives. Whether it was through mental arithmetic or logical thinking, humans have found ways to make use of their cognitive skills for good. In today's world, brainstroming is more than just a way to think better; it's an essential part of any successful life. Here are five ways you can use brainstroming in your everyday life:
