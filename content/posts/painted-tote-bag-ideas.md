The benefits of creative ideas.
Creative ideas can have a variety of benefits – from helping people find solutions to problems to boosting creativity. Here are four examples:
1. Creative ideas can help people solve problems. For example, a creative idea could be coming up with a new way to store food, such as using an airtight container or freezing food in order to make it last longer.

2. Creative ideas can also help people feel more Productive. When someone has a great idea for a product, they tend to be more inspired and motivated to produce the product themselves. This is especially true if the product is new and innovative – something that almost all products have at some point in their development cycle!

3. Finally, creative ideas can boost creativity overall.

Patenting andprotecting inventions
Patents protect inventions from being infringing by others. Patent applications are often filled out in a variety of different ways, including but not limited to, the following: 
-Inventor biography 
-Chemical formula 
-Description of invention 
-Problem to be solved 
-Steps and method for solving the problem 
-Grant of patent 
When an inventor fills out a patent application, they are typically taking on a lot of risk. They could potentially face lawsuits if their invention is copied or used without permission. To help protect their invention, many inventors choose to patent their ideas instead of just selling them outright. By filing a patent application, an inventor is able to make sure that their invention is protected from infringement and can also get feedback from potential customers or partners about how their product might work.

New ideas are always exciting, no matter how old they may be. For example, consider the idea of a "universal basic income." This would be a monthly payment to every citizen that is free of charge, regardless of their income. This would help to encourage people to work and improve the economy. Additionally, there are many other potential ideas that could be implemented into society if given enough time and thought.
