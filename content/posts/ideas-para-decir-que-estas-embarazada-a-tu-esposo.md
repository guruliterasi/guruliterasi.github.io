What are big ideas?
Big ideas are crucial to any startup or organization. They can provide the spark that ignites a new idea, or provide a way to focus on an existing problem and start solving it. By definition, big ideas are large enough to be considered as a serious possibility, but also small enough that they don’t disrupt or take over a company’s day-to-day operations. Here are three examples of big ideas that have helped startups and organizations grow:
1. Social media: A major driver of growth for startups is the ability to connect with customers on a personal level. By understanding how people use social media, companies can develop marketing strategies that work better for their target audience and create more engaging content.

2. Mobile app development: Another key element of growth for startups is creating innovative mobile apps that appeal to a wider range of users.
