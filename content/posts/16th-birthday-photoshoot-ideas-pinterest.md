Conclusion: How can creativity help you achieve success and stay creative?
Creativity can help you achieve success and stay creative. Here are a few tips to get started: 
1. Find an outlet for your creativity. When you have something to explore, creativity will flow freely. So find something that interests you and start writing or drawing inspiration from it. 
2. Connect with others like yourself. There is no secret to success if you want it - reach out to people who share your same interests and passions in order to get their ideas flowing. If all else fails, talking about your ideas with a friend or family member can be very helpful in inspiring new thoughts and ideas. 
3. Take the time to practice often. Practice makes perfect - so practice what you love most, no matter how difficult it may be to do so regularly (and don't forget- sometimes practice makes perfect).
