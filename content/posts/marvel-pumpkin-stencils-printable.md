Origins of innovation: What led to the development of innovation?
Innovation is a concept that goes back to ancient Greece. They believed in the idea of “oplotic” knowledge, which is the ability to share ideas and concepts between people. This led to the development of communication and transportation systems, as well as new ways of producing food. Inventors such as Leonardo da Vinci and Ben Franklin were also responsible for developing new technology and products.
