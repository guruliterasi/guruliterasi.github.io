Innovation is the ability to come up with new ways of doing things. It can be in the form of a new product, service, or idea. Innovation is important because it gives businesses and individuals the chance to try something and see if it works or not.

Economic innovation happens when companies or governments find new ways to make money by selling their products or services.
