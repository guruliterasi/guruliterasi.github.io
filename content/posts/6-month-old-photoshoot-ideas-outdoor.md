The definition of creativity and how to achieve it: What is needed for creative achievement?
Creativity is a complex and multi-layered concept. To achieve it, one typically needs to possess several components that are usually interconnected. One of the most important qualities needed for creativity is imagination. Imagination can be used to come up with new ideas or solutions, as well as to generate new concepts or plans. It is also necessary to have an understanding of what one wants to create, and how best to do so. The second component of creativity is problem-solving. When faced with a difficult challenge, it is often helpful to have a plan and know what steps need to be taken in order to complete the task at hand.

How can people start thinking about new ideas?
Most people think of ideas when they are brainstorming, but there are other ways to come up with new ideas. Sometimes all you need is a new perspective. Here are three tips to help you get started: 
1. Give yourself time: Sometimes the best way to come up with new ideas is to allow yourself time to think about them. Don’t try to come up with any ideas in an instant. Take your time and consider everything that you have said before coming up with a new idea. 

2. Be open-minded: Once you have considered some potential ideas, it’s important that you be open-minded about them. If something doesn’t sound right or feels too farfetched, don’t be afraid to change your mind after thinking about it more. Remember that every idea has at least one potential application.
