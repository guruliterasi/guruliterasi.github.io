The science of creativity
A person's creativity is often thought of as a mysterious quality that cannot be measured or studied. However, there is a growing body of research that suggests otherwise. The science of creativity is an interdisciplinary field that examines the nature and development of creative abilities.
While there is no single definition of creativity, it is generally defined as the ability to produce new and innovative ideas. Creativity is often seen as a rare or elusive quality, but recent research suggests that it is more common than previously thought.

There are many different factors that contribute to creativity. Some of these include intelligence, genes, environment, and motivation.

What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything – a new way of looking at something, coming up with new ways to do something, or coming up with a new idea for a product. There are so many creative ideas out there that it can be hard to know what to choose from. Here are five tips to help you get started: 
1) Get inspired by your surroundings. When you're looking for creative ideas, take in the environment around you and try to come up with some ideas for products that would reflect the atmosphere. 
2) Be open to change. If you're not sure what you want your product to look like, don't be afraid to experiment and see what different styles work well for you. 
3) Take time for yourself. It's important to spend time relaxing and focusing on your creativity instead of working on things that are taking up your time.
