How to get started with creative ideas: What should you do first?
Creative ideas are a key part of any business or creative project. However, getting started can be difficult. Here are four tips to help you get started:
1. Look at your goals 
First, ask yourself what kind of creativity you want to achieve. Do you want to create new ideas, or simply improve on old ones? If your answer is "both," look for ways to combine your two skills. Are you interested in creating products, services, or designs? Then look into Lynda.com and online resources such as Illustrator and Photoshop for help.
2. Get organized 
Once you have a basic idea of what you want to accomplish, it's time to start thinking about how to achieve it. Try creating a timeline/schedule for your project and working with someone else who can help guide you along the way.

1st idea:
Ideas are the lifeblood of any business. Without fresh ideas, businesses would quickly become stagnant and fail to thrive. Though generating new ideas can be challenging, it is essential for businesses to keep the flow of ideas going in order to stay relevant and succeed.
There are a few ways to generate new ideas. One way is to hold brainstorming sessions with employees. This gets everyone in the company thinking about new possibilities and can often lead to some great concepts. Another way to come up with new ideas is to look at what other businesses in your industry are doing and try to improve upon it. Finally, don’t be afraid to think outside the box – sometimes the best ideas come from left field.

If you want your business to stay ahead of the competition, it is imperative that you generate new ideas on a regular basis.
