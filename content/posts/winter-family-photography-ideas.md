Creative process: How does creativity work?
Creativity is a process that can be broken down into three main parts: Ideation, Execution, and Delivery. Ideation is the process of coming up with ideas or solutions to problems. Execution is the task of putting these ideas into action and making them a reality. Delivery is the final step in the creative process, which includes making sure that the ideas are implemented and realized properly.

Different brainstorming techniques
When it comes to brainstorming, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. The best way to brainstorm depends on the situation and the type of project you’re working on. Here are three different brainstorming techniques to try:
1. Brainwriting

Brainwriting is a great option when you need to generate a lot of ideas quickly. To brainwrite, each person in the group writes down their ideas on a piece of paper. Then, everyone passes their paper to the person next to them, who adds their own ideas. This continues until everyone has had a chance to add to all of the ideas.

2. Round Robin

The round robin technique is similar to brainwriting, but with one key difference: instead of passing around a piece of paper, each person takes turns verbally sharing their ideas with the group.
