Brainstorming techniques
When it comes to brainstorming, there are a variety of techniques that can be used in order to generate new ideas. One popular technique is known as brainwriting, which involves writing down ideas on paper or in a digital document. This can be done individually or in a group setting.
Another common brainstorming technique is known as mind mapping. This involves creating a visual representation of ideas, often using colors and images. This can help to stimulate the creative part of the brain and can be used to organize thoughts in a more logical manner.

Lastly, brainstorming can also be done through problem-solving techniques such as SCAMPER. This acronym stands for Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, and Reverse/Rearrange.

What is a quality idea?
Quality is a key word in any business, and when it comes to ideas, it’s no different. Quality ideas are ones that can be improved upon and that could lead to increased profits for the business. Here are four ways to create quality ideas:
1. Develop a unique selling proposition (USP) for your business. This is the main thing that will differentiate your product or service from those of your competitors. It should be clear, concise, and easy to understand for customers who are looking for something new and different.

2. Offer discounts or special deals on your products or services. This will entice customers to come into your store or office and buy what you have to offer. It also helps keep customers around longer since they know that you’ll be offering something of value in return for their money.
