Creative ideas can be anything, but they typically fall into one of five types: strategic, normative, Primal, and vague. 
Strategic ideas are those that focus on the overall strategy of a project or organization. Normative ideas deal with how things should be done in order to achieve a certain result. Primal ideas are the raw materials that creative minds start with and use to come up with new and innovative ways to do things. Vague ideas are those that are too general or abstract for anyone to really understand them without more information.

The role of innovation in business:
Many businesses, including many small businesses, depend on innovation in order to remain competitive. Innovation can be defined as the application of new knowledge and ideas to solve a problem or increase efficiency in a business. Innovation is an essential part of business success, and small businesses especially need to be aware of how they can benefit from it.
There are several ways that small businesses can benefit from innovation, but the most important way is through increased efficiency. Efficiency is the ability of a business to produce goods and services efficiently using resources limited by cost or time. By increasing efficiency, small businesses can save money on their product or service offerings, which will then allow them to invest more in their other products and services. This increased investment will result in better customer service, higher profits, and more sustainable growth.

Increased innovation also leads to new product innovations.

Idea 4: Write about a time when you created something new and loved it
When you're feeling inspired, your best bet is to focus on something that's new and exciting. Whether it's a new project or an idea you've had for a while but haven't put into practice, taking the time to start creating is always a good way to get ahead. Here are four creative ideas to get you started: 
1. Start with an old project – sometimes the most interesting things come from giving something up and starting from scratch. If you have an older project that you don't use as often anymore, give it a try again. Not only will it be more interesting and challenging, but you'll also have more experience and knowledge to work with.

2. Take on a new challenge – sometimes one of the best things about being creative is finding new ways to do things.

Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that had never been thought of before. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new way to make your favorite candy, or developing a new way to fight cancer.
