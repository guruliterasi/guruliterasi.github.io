Take flight!: Are there any other ways you can use your creativity to help solve problems?
Creativity can be used in a number of ways to solve problems. One way is to come up with big ideas.

2) brainstorming – This process helps you come up with multiple solutions at the same time and then put them all together to see which one might work best.
