There are many different types of creative art, but some of the most common are painting, sculpture, film, and music. While there are many great artists out there who specialize in one type of creative art, it is important to have an understanding of what the different types of creativity can do for an artist. For example, if you’re a painter and you want to create pieces featuring color and light, then you might use sculpture as your medium.
