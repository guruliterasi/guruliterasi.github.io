brainstorming is an effective tool for coming up with new ideas. However, there are a few things you can do to make the process more efficient and effective. First, try to group your ideas together so that they are easier to understand. Additionally, use active listening techniques to help you hear and understand what your potential clients or customers are saying. Finally, be sure to keep track of what you come up with during brainstorming so that you can later refer back to it and develop new ideas based on what you heard.
