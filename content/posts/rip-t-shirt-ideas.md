Ideas that work: What makes a good idea successful?
Ideas that work have a clear path to fruition and are able to be scaled up or down as needed. They also have a sense of humor, which can make them relatable and fun to follow. Here are six ideas that have been successful in the past:
1. Create a website – A website is one of the most important tools an entrepreneur has. It allows potential customers to learn more about your product or service, and it can help you build a following. A well-designed website is easy to navigate, provides useful information on your product or service, and looks professional.

2. Develop an app – App development is another popular idea that has been successful in the past. An app allows users to do something specific, such as ordering food or shopping for products online, without having to visit multiple websites or go through customer service.

How to brainstorm effectively.
1. When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few key things to keep in mind in order to make the process as effective as possible. 
2. First and foremost, it’s important to create a relaxed and comfortable environment for everyone involved. This means no judgment, no pressure, and no distractions. 
3. Once you have the right setting, it’s time to start generating ideas. The best way to do this is to encourage free-flowing thought and open-mindedness. 
4. Brainstorming sessions should be all about quantity over quality at first – worry about filtering and refining later on. 
5. It can be helpful to have someone act as a facilitator during the session, keeping things on track and making sure everyone has a chance to share their ideas.
