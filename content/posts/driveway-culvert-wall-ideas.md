Technology has a lot to offer in helping us achieve our goals, but it should be used responsibly. There are a number of ways technology can help us achieve our goals, but some are more harmful than others. Here are three examples:

3. Technology can help us track our progress and organize our work more effectively. This can lead to better management of resources and improved productivity overall.
