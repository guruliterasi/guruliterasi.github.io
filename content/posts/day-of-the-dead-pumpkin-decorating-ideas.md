Idea 1: Why did this idea come to mind?
This idea came to mind because of my son's 6th grade science project. In it, he was trying to figure out why a bee falls off of a tree. He found that the bee's wings would eventually break and they would fall to the ground. He thought this could be a fun experiment to do with his classmates.

Conclusion: What to do if You Start a Blog but Do Not Have Any Ideas
A lot of people start blogs, but they don't know what to do next. Here are some tips to help you get started: 
1) Choose a topic you're interested in. Once you've chosen a topic, research how to write about it effectively. You can find helpful articles and tutorials online or in books.
2) Start with a small audience. If your blog only has a handful of readers, you'll likely be able to start off by posting updates and tasks related to your topic rather than developing your content further. 
3) Take some time for planning and editing. Once you've created an initial post, make sure to spend time editing it and proofreading it for errors. This will help make sure that your blog is well-written and error-free before publishing it!
