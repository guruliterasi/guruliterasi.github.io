The 4 Types of Ideas: Objectives: What is the end goal? Creative: How do you come up with the idea? Imaginary: What could be possible? Fantastical: Is this really happening or is it a dream? Practical: How would this work in reality? futuristic: What if this happened in the future?
Ideas are a necessary part of any business or project. They can be used to come up with solutions to problems or to create new ideas. However, they can also be used for evil purposes. Some people use ideas as tools to manipulate others, while others use them as vehicles for their own creativity. 
The different types of objectives you might come up with in order to create an idea are imaginary, fantastic, and possible. Imaginary objectives are where you forget the end goal or what the final outcome will be. Fantastical objectives are where you think about things that couldn’t actually happen but could still make senses if done in a certain way. Finally, is objective is where youumberofideasyougeneratedbeforecomingupwiththefinalobjective.

Taking Action: How do you take action when you have creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new products to a better way to do things. When you have creative ideas, it can be hard to know what to do with them. Here are three tips for taking action on your ideas:
1. Research your idea thoroughly before starting anything. This will help you understand the feasibility of the idea and whether or not it is something that is possible or even desirable.

2. Make a prototype of your idea. This will give you a rough idea of how your product or service will look and feel. You can then test this out on customers or see if there is enough demand for the idea to actually start manufacturing it.

3. Take action! Once you have some prototypes and data, it’s time to take action!

Section 4: How to overcome creative blocks.
Nearly everyone experiences creative blocks at some point in their lives. For some people, it happens frequently; for others, more rarely. But whether you’re a professional artist or someone who just likes to dabble in creativity from time to time, it can be frustrating when you suddenly find yourself unable to come up with new ideas.
There are a number of ways you can overcome creative blocks. One is to simply take a break from whatever project you’re working on and come back to it later with fresh eyes. Sometimes all it takes is a little distance to see things in a new light and come up with the solutions you couldn’t see before.

Another way to overcome creative blocks is to brainstorm with someone else. Collaborating with someone can help spark new ideas and give you perspective on problems you’re having trouble solving on your own.
