The difference between creativity and inspiration: What are some of the benefits of having more creativity?
Creativity is a term often used to describe different aspects of one’s life. It can be used to describe things like coming up with new ideas, or coming up with solutions to problems. Inspiration, on the other hand, is a more specific word that refers to a feeling or emotion that one experiences when looking at something and thinking about how it could be improved.
There are several benefits of having more inspiration in one’s life. For example, inspiration can help you come up with new ideas and strategies for solving problems. It can also help you feel more motivated and inspired when working on projects. In addition, inspiration can help you become more creative in your own artwork and writing. Finally, inspiration can help you develop your overall business idea or concept.

Invention: The history of invention
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, whether it is a new product, service or technology. It has been around for centuries and has had a wide variety of outcomes. 
One of the earliest examples of invention was in 100 BC when two brothers, Eudoxus and Philoctetes, came up with the idea of writing. They were the first to patent their invention and it soon became a household word. 

Inventions have also been used for military purposes. The world’s first anti-tank grenade was created by Raphael Salomon in 1795 and it was used in World War 1 to help destroy German tanks. 

Today, innovation continues to play an important role in our lives. There are many different ways that innovation can be used to create new products, services and technologies.
