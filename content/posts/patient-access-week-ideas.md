The benefits of brainstroming: Increased creativity, productivity, and thought leadership.
A recent study by the University of Utah found that brainstroming – the practice of generating new ideas and solutions while under stress – can lead to increased creativity, productivity, and thought leadership. Participants in the study were given a series of challenges to work on during a set time frame, then were asked to produce ideas for a new product or service. The results showed that those who did brainstroming fared better in terms of creativity, productivity, and thought leadership than those who didn’t.

Whether you’re looking to boosting your business acumen or simply sparking new thinking ideas, brainstroming is an essential tool for success.
