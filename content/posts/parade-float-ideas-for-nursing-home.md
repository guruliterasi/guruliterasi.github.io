Patenting an invention: What is the process of getting an invention registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office?

The first step is to come up with an idea for a product or service that you want to patent. You then need to create a patent application and provide ample detail about your invention. After all of this, you'll need to wait for the USPTO to review your application and decide if you'reeligible for a patent. If you're approved, you'll then have towait for your patent to be issued and start making sure that your invention is being used in commerce.
