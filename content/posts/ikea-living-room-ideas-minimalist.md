How can it be implemented?
In many ways, the implementation of a new idea can be difficult. However, with a little creativity and perseverance, it can be done. Here are some ideas to get your new concept off the ground: 
1. Start by thinking about what you want your product or service to do. What needs will it address? What are the benefits of using your product or service? These questions will help you to create a vision for your business and come up with a plan of how to make that happen. 
2. Once you have a vision, it's time to start planning how to achieve it. This can be done in many different ways, but one important step is creating an outline of how your business will operate and what products or services will be offered. This will help you develop marketing plans and identify where money should go in order to bring your vision to life.

Marketing: How to market your invention idea
Assuming you have an invention idea and want to market it, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First, it's important to do your research and understand both the industry and your potential customers. Who is your target market? What needs does your product address? How does your product compare to other similar products on the market? Once you have a solid understanding of these things, you can begin developing a marketing strategy.
