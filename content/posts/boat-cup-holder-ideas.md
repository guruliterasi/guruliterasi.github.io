How do you come up with new ideas?
As a creative thinker, you face many challenges when coming up with new ideas. One challenge is that it can be difficult to remember just what worked the last time you came up with an idea. Additionally, it can be difficult to come up with novel approaches to problem solving.  So how do you come up with new ideas? 
One approach is to brainstorm. By brainstorming, you can get rid of any old ideas and start from scratch. Additionally, by using headphones or other distractions, you can create an environment in which you are unable to think of any other ideas. Finally, if you have a specific idea in mind but are not sure how to bring it to life, then you can try outframing or milking an existing idea for new potential insights.
