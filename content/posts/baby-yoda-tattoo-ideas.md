The three types of big ideas: A crazy idea, a good idea, and a bad idea
There are three types of big ideas: crazy, good, and bad. Crazy ideas are always exciting, and can help to change the course of history. Good ideas have the potential to make a big impact on people and the world. However, there is always risk associated with them- some might be great, while others might not be so great after all. But when it comes time to make a decision, it’s important to weigh the risks and benefits of each idea before coming up with a decision.
Bad Ideas are simply terrible, and often have no chance of becoming anything other than infamous failures. They may seem like something that could never work or might even lead to disaster- but in reality, they often do just that. It’s important to be vigilant when assessing any new idea- especially those with such potential for disaster.

Conclusion
Innovation has the ability to create new value for businesses and organizations, but it must be managed carefully in order to be successful. The process of innovation involves four distinct stages: ideation, development, commercialization, and scaling. Each stage presents its own challenges and opportunities, but the rewards can be great if innovation is managed effectively.
Organizations that innovate successfully tend to have a few key attributes in common. They are open to new ideas, willing to take risks, and have a culture that supports creativity and experimentation. They also have a clear understanding of their customers’ needs and how they can be met in new ways.

 Innovation is essential for businesses to thrive in today’s ever-changing marketplace. But it’s not enough to simply have good ideas – they must be executed well in order to create lasting value.
