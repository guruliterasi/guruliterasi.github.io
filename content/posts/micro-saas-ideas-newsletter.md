Invention as a process: How does an inventor create a new product or idea?
Invention can be defined as the process of creating a new product or idea. Inventions result from the combined efforts of an inventor and their team. The team may include scientists, engineers, and designers. The goal of the team is to come up with a solution that meets the needs of the customer or user.
Invention is often a difficult process because it involves many steps and requires a lot of creativity. In order to create a successful invention, the inventor must have a clear idea of what they want to achieve and how they plan on achieving it. Without these plans, it is difficult to create a product that meets the needs of users.

what is creative art?
Creative art is a type of art that is open to interpretation. It can be anything from painting and sculpture, to music and dance. Creative art is about expressing yourself and your ideas, in a way that is unique to you.
There are no rules or guidelines to creative art, which is what makes it so special. It is a way for you to express yourself freely, without having to conform to anyone else’s standards.

Creative art can be a great outlet for emotions and feelings that you may not be able to express in words. It can be therapeutic, and help you to connect with your inner thoughts and feelings.
