The four steps to creating ideas: problem solving, coming up with a good title, writing a proposal, and taking action.
1. Get clear about what you want to achieve. What are your goals? What is the problem that you want to solve? 
2. Brainstorm a group of people who can help you develop your ideas. This can be a group of friends, family, or co-workers. 
3. Brainstorm a title for your project. This will give you an idea of what your project will be called and help organize all the different parts of your project together. 
4. Write out your proposal for potential investors or clients. This will give them a detailed account of what you plan to do and why it’s important for them to invest in your project.

Conclusion: What are some things to keep in mind when trying to achieve creative goals?
Creative goals can be anything from making a beautiful piece of art to designing a new product. There are several things to keep in mind when trying to achieve creative goals. One important thing to keep in mind is that you should always aim for the best possible outcome. If you do not care about the end result, then your creativity will likely not be productive. Another important thing to consider when trying to achieve creative goals is how you plan on achieving them. Do not try to accomplish too many things at once, as this will likely lead to frustration and further planning problems. Lastly, do not forget that creativity does not have to come from inside yourself – it can also come from outside sources. When looking for inspiration, look for stories or articles that might help jog your memory and create new ideas.
