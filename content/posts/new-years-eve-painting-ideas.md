Conclusion
A good conclusion is the final ingredient in a creative work. It gives the audience a sense of closure and resolution, and can leave them feeling satisfied or even uplifted. A weak conclusion, on the other hand, can leave the audience feeling let down and dissatisfied.
To create a strong conclusion, start by thinking about what you want your audience to take away from your work. What are the main points you want to make? Once you know what you want to say, find a way to say it that is both memorable and impactful.

End with a bang, not a whimper. A powerful image, striking turn of phrase, or thought-provoking question can all make for a memorable conclusion. Whatever you do, don't simply repeat what came before or restate your thesis in a boring way.

Invention: How did one person come up with an idea that led to a new product or technology?
An inventor is someone who comes up with an idea for a new product or technology. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new way to cook food, or inventing a new alloy that can be used in metalworking. In some cases, an inventor may develop the idea while working on another project, and then take it further by working on the details until they come up with a product or technology that they think will be useful. Some inventors are also able to come up with ideas while they are away from their home country, or during off-hours at work.

Invention history: What inspired various inventors to come up with new ideas?
Invention history is a fascinating topic to explore, as it offers insights into the creativity and motivation behind inventors. Some of the most famous and influential inventors in history include Leonardo da Vinci, Nikola Tesla, Charles Darwin, and Marie Curie. Each inventor had their own unique ideas that led to new technologies and products. In some cases, these ideas were simply firsts – for example, da Vinci’s drawing of a three-dimensional image in paper was the first use of a technical drawing instrument in history. However, other inventions may have had more significant impacts on society or the economy. For example, Darwin’s theory of evolution led to the development of mass produced products like cars and machines. This theory also helped to change how people view themselves and their environment – thanks in part to his invention of the scientific method.
