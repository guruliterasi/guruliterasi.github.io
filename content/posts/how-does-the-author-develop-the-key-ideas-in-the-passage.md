Conclusion: We need to start thinking big when it comes to ideas.
We need to start thinking big when it comes to ideas. If we don't, we're going to get stuck in a rut and never be able to break out of it. There are so many great ideas out there that we just can't put our finger on what to do with them all. So how do we go about finding the ones that will work for us? There are a few things that we can do in order to help ourselves get started: 
1) Take some time for yourself – We all have moments where we feel like we don't have time for anything. But if you take the time to step away from your work or project and relax, you'll usually find yourself with more inspiration than you ever thought possible. It's important to remember that if you're not taking care of yourself, you're going to suffer in the long run.

Invention as a process: How does one come up with new ideas?
One important step in the process of coming up with new ideas is to have a brainstorm. A brainstorming session is an opportunity for individuals to come up with new ideas without having to worry about whether or not they will be accepted. By using a brainstorming session, you can quickly and easily come up with new ideas that could potentially solve a problem. 
The best way to create a good brainstorming session is by creating a agenda beforehand and setting boundaries for who can participate. You should also make sure that everyone has something they are willing to share, so that everyone has an equal say in the discussion. It is important to do this because it will help free up energy and allow everyone to focus on their individual Ideas rather than worrying about how others might react. Once you have started the meeting, it’s important to give everyone some time before taking any decisions.

For adults, creative art can reduce stress levels, improve moods, and increase brain function. It can also help build bonds with others who enjoy similar activities.

No matter what your age, taking some time to be creative can do wonders for your mind and body. So go ahead and pick up that paintbrush or clay – you might just surprise yourself at how much you enjoy it!
