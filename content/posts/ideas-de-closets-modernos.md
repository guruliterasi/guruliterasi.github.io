describes an invention: What is it?
Invention ideas are a dime a dozen, but sometimes they're so innovative and amazing that you can't believe it. This is what happened to the inventor of the electric car, Nikola Tesla.

For example, the wheel was invented by a man named Musa Acar who used a simple piece of wood and a stone to create the first true bike. Similarly, the telephone was created with just two wires and a wooden box.

The process of innovation
Innovation is a process that can be divided into four distinct stages: ideation, development, implementation, and diffusion.
Ideation is the stage in which new ideas are generated. This can involve brainstorming sessions, market research, or simply observing the world around you. Once an idea has been generated, it must be developed. This stage includes testing the feasibility of the idea and refining it until it is ready to be implemented.

Implementation is when the innovative idea is put into practice. This stage can be challenging, as it requires bringing the idea to life and making it work within the context of your business or organisation. Diffusion is the final stage of innovation, and refers to how widely the new idea is adopted. This stage is often influenced by factors such as marketing and word-of-mouth.

Innovation is the process of translating an idea or invention into a good or service that creates value or for which customers will pay. It is a process of creative destruction that transforms an idea or invention into a commercial opportunity. The success of an innovation depends on its ability to create value for customers, businesses, and society.
