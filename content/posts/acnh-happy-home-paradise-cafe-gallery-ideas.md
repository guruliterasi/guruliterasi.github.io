The challenges of big ideas: What can prevent them from becoming successful?
When it comes to big ideas, sometimes the obstacles are simply too great. When it comes to innovation, often times what's required is a willingness to take on new challenges and risk everything for the sake of something better. But in some cases, taking such risks can actually backfire, leading to less innovation and more stagnation. Here are six examples of how big ideas can fail:
1) Failing to appreciate the uniqueness of each idea

One of the biggest challenges faced by big ideas is that they often come from unique perspectives or points of view. This can be difficult to take on and even harder to understand, let alone replicate. In order for an idea to succeed, it needs to be seen as unique and valuable in its own right – not just by those who came up with it but also by those who will use it in the future.

The concept of brainstroming: what it is, how it works, and how to use it
Brainstroming is a term that refers to the act of focusing one’s attention on one specific topic and then taking deep, calming breaths. It can be used as a tool for focus, relaxation, and problem-solving. Brainstroming can be done in any situation, but it is most effective when used during meditation or stress relief. Here are five tips for using brainstroming to achieve success:
1. Make sure you have an EMPATHY FOR THE TOPIC YOU ARE FOCUSING ON.

Before beginning brainstroming, it is important to have an understanding of the topic you are trying to focus on. If you don’t care about the issue at hand, your mind will become clouded with distractions and it will be difficult to find the energy necessary to focus on the task at hand.
