Conclusion: The importance of big ideas
In any field, be it history or physics, there are certain big ideas that provide a framework for understanding the subject. In history, for example, the big ideas might include causes of historical events, or different interpretations of the past. In physics, the big ideas might include the laws of motion or the principles of energy.
Big ideas are important because they give us a way to make sense of complex information. They help us see the connections between different concepts and see how they fit together to form a coherent whole. Without big ideas, we would be lost in a sea of facts and data.

So next time you're struggling to understand a concept, ask yourself: what is the big idea? Once you have that, everything else will start to fall into place.

The future of food: How will we consume food in the future?
The future of food is still in question, but some ideas that have been floated include: 1) meal delivery services such as Uber and Deliveroo; 2) eating out less often; and 3) growing more of our food in the home. 
While these are all plausible options, there is also the potential for even more niche or Sustainable eaters to emerge, who will only consume sustainable or earth-friendly products. So what does this mean for consumers? 

When it comes to food, it means looking out for not just sustainability but also flavor. If you want your food to taste good, it needs to be nutritious and fresh. Fresh produce tastes better and is more refreshing on the palate, so if you can find earth-friendly or sustainable options that do both, go for it!
