The impact of creativity on art: How does creativity affect the artist?
Creativity is a vital force in the artistâ€™s life. Without creativity, art would be little more than phantasy or dreams. It has been said that creativity is the ability to see things in a new light and to take risks. In order to be truly creative, an artist must have an outlet for their ideas and must be willing to experiment. Some artists rely solely on their own intuition, while others need help from others in order to get started. The impact of creativity on art is complex and difficult to study fully, but there are some general patterns that can be discerned. First and foremost, creativity often leads to innovation and change. This can lead to new ways of looking at old ideas or can result in the discovery of hitherto unknown aspects of the arts. Secondarily, creativity produces fresh perspectives on what has already been done.
