What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything you want them to be. Whether it’s making a new fashion statement, coming up with a new business idea, or coming up with a creative solution to a problem, creativity is always on the horizon. However, when it comes to creativity, there are some key rules that you should follow in order to be successful. Here are four tips for creativity: 1) Be open-minded: Be aware of what you’re thinking and how it could be improved. If you’re not sure where your ideas come from or what they could achieve, ask around or talk to people who have experience in the field. 2) Take time to think things through: Don’t just go into ideas without any thought process behind them first.
