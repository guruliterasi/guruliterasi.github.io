How to be creative:
Creative art is a way to express yourself and connect with the world. There are many ways to be creative, and it all comes down to what you enjoy. Here are some tips on how to be more creative:
1. Find an outlet for your creativity. Whether it’s creating artwork, writing, or any other form of expression, find an outlet for your creativity. This can be anything from painting in your bedroom to drawing in a park by the waterfront.

2. Experiment with different mediums and techniques. If you’re stuck on what you want to create, experiment with different mediums and techniques. For example, if you’re a painter, try using oil or watercolors instead of pencils or crayons.

How innovation benefits society:
Innovation benefits society by increasing productivity, innovation reducing costs, and improving the quality of products. Productivity is the amount of work done per hour. Reducing costs is the lowering of prices or the reduction in cost of producing a good or service. Improving quality is the improvement of something that does not meet all expectations, for example a product that is not as effective as it should be. Innovation can be thought of as any change in how something is done, from making a new product to changing how services are provided.
