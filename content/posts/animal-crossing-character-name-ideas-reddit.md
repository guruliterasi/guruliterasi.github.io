Definition of art: The process of creating a piece of art
As somebody who spends a great deal of time creating art, it's important to have a clear definition for what art is. Whether you're talking about creative writing, painting, or sculpture, there are some commonalities that all art possess. So without further ado, here's the definition for art:

2. Art requires an artist to put their own feelings and emotions into their work, which can make it sometimes difficult to see how it could be seen as anything other than pure creativity.
