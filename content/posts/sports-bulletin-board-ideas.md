1st idea:
Ideas are the lifeblood of any business. Without fresh ideas, businesses would quickly become stagnant and fail to thrive. Though generating new ideas can be challenging, it is essential for businesses to keep the flow of ideas going in order to stay relevant and succeed.
There are a few ways to generate new ideas. One way is to hold brainstorming sessions with employees. This gets everyone in the company thinking about new possibilities and can often lead to some great concepts. Another way to come up with new ideas is to look at what other businesses in your industry are doing and try to improve upon it. Finally, don’t be afraid to think outside the box – sometimes the best ideas come from left field.

If you want your business to stay ahead of the competition, it is imperative that you generate new ideas on a regular basis.

What are big ideas?
In business, big ideas are the seeds of new business models and products. They can be anything from a novel idea to a radical change in how a product is produced. They can also be inspired by something that has worked before, or by something that someone else has tried and found to be successful. 
The key to getting your big idea off the ground is to have a clear vision for it, and then come up with specific goals and timelines for making it a reality. There are several ways to generate big ideas, including brainstorming with friends or family, talking with experts in your field, researching existing products or services, or reading articles on the subject. 

If you're not sure what kind of big idea you want to pursue, there are plenty of resources available to help you get started.

The benefits of creativity
Creativity has been linked with improved mental health, better educational outcomes and even enhanced workplace performance.
A recent study found that people who engage in creative activities are more likely to report higher levels of well-being and life satisfaction.

 creativity can also lead to better educational outcomes. A study of 3,000 primary school children in the UK found that those who took part in creative activities had higher grades than those who didn’t.

And it’s not just students who benefit from being more creative – employees do too. A study of 1,500 workers found that those who had high levels of creativity were more engaged with their work and had lower levels of absenteeism.
