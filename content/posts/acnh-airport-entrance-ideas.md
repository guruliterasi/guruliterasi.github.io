Invention ideas are a common part of everyday life, but they can be quite extraordinary. Some inventions are so small and simple that they might not even be considered invention, but they have the potential to change the way we live and work. One such invention is the electric toothbrush, which was first invented by a man named Samuel Morse in 1814. It has since been used to clean teeth and remove plaque from teeth, and it has even been used in bariatric surgery.

Trends in mobility: How will new transportation systems make it easier for people to connect and do their day-to-day tasks?
In the coming years, new transportation systems are going to make it easier for people to connect and do their day-to-day tasks. One of the most significant changes will be the growth of ride-sharing services. Ride-sharing platforms allow people to borrow a car from someone else, and then use it to drive around town or go to different places. This type of transportation system is becoming more popular every day, and it is just a matter of time until it becomes more widespread.
Another major change in the future will be the increasing popularity of bike lanes. Bike lanes are special pavement designs that help cyclists have more space to move around. These lanes are often built near busy intersections so that drivers can‚Äôt easily run into them.
