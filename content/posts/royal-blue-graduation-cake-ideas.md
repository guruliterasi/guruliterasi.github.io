What makes a good idea?
Every idea has a differentiator and what makes a good one is always subjective. Some people might find the concept interesting, others might not. There are many factors to consider when choosing an idea, such as how well it will be executed, who will be using it, and whether it is something that users are already passionate about. 
One of the most important things to consider when coming up with ideas is whether or not they are big enough to warrant investment. If an idea is too small or unimportant to warrant attention, it will likely be forgotten or passed over. A good example of this was the iPhone app Gap which was only released in Australia but contained massive potential because users were already interested in fashion and had tonnes of feedback. Another example would be Square which was originally considered a payment platform but has since become a popular social media platform for businesses and individuals.

How to start a small business
Starting a small business can be a daunting task, but there are a few key steps that you can take to make it easier. Here are some tips to get started:
1. think about your target market. What is your main focus? Are you selling products or services? Do you have an existing customer base? If not, what do you need to do to reach them?

2. research your competition. Do you have any competitors in your industry that you could study and contrast yourself against? This will help provide direction for your business idea.

3. create a plan of attack. How will you market and sell your product or service? How will you generate revenue? What type of marketing strategy will work best for YOU and YOUR business? This information should be included in the business plan (or indeed, anywhere else related to starting a small business).
