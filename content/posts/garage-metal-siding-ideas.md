What is invention?
Invention is the process of creating a new product or service from scratch. Invention has been around for centuries, and it is not limited to just technology. Inventions can be found in all industries, including medicine, retail, and food. There are many different types of inventions, and they can be broken down into five main categories: mechanical objects (such as watches), chemical substances (such as pesticides), transportation systems (such as railways), machines (such as cars and planes), and devices (such as calculators).

History of innovation:
Innovation has been a part of human history for as long as humans have been able to think about it. From the early civilizations that developed methods of making things that didn't exist before, to the modern day innovators who are constantly creating new ways to improve life and make it more efficient, innovation is something that has always been a part of our lives. And yet, there was once a time where innovation was practically nonexistent in most cultures. This was the era known as the Dark Ages.
The Dark Ages were an era in human history when creativity was almost non-existent and innovation was virtually absent. While some aspects of this time period did experience some form of innovation, such as new methods of farming or weapons, most aspects of society were either unaltered or slowly improving upon what existed before.
