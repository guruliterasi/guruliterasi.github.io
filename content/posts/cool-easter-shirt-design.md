Conclusion: Why should we be interested in innovation?
Innovation is an ever-growing field of science and technology that is changing the way we do things. It offers a new perspective on how to improve products, services and ideas. Innovation has the ability to change the course of history, and it’s important for businesses to be interested in it. Here are four reasons why innovation should be on businesses’ radar:
1) Innovation can create new opportunities: When companies explore new ways to produce or distribute their products or services, they can find new customers and potentially new markets. This can lead to increased profits and growth.

2) Innovation can save money: Innovation often leads to cost savings, which can help make businesses more profitable. For example, imagine a company that finds a way to produce a product without using traditional methods. This could lead to significant savings in production costs.

The power of creativity: how does creativity work?
Creativity is an intricate and often mysterious process that goes beyond the simple act of creating. It involves a deep understanding of the creative process, as well as the individual’s own personality and environment. This understanding can be gained through years of practice or by simply thinking about creativity in new ways.
There are many theories about creativity, but one that has been dominant for many years is the Creative Art Theory. This theory suggests that creativity comes from a combination of two things: the artist’s own ideas and the environment they are working in. The artist creates what they see and hear in their surroundings, then uses this information to create their own masterpiece. The environment also plays a role in creativity, by providing ideas and inspiration to the artist. When these two elements combine, it leads to a unique piece of art that can be enjoyed by anyone who visits it.
