Definition of creativity: How does creativity differ from regularity?
Creativity is the ability of a person to come up with new and innovative ways to do something. It can be defined in many different ways, but in general, creativity refers to the ability to come up with new and innovative ideas. This varies from person to person, so it really depends on what you're looking for in a definition. However, some key definitions of creativity include: • Artistry: The quality or practice of producing creative works • Innovation: Coming up with anew or novel solutions to problems or challenges • Creativity Loop: A continually evolving process that leads to new ideas and results 
What makes creativity so special? One major factor is that it doesn't always have a standard definition. Unlike regularity, creativity doesn't just involve coming up with new things- it can also involve coming up with ideas that are impossible to accomplish by any other means.

Invention ideas can be as simple as a new product or as complex as a new way to do an old thing. Whatever the invention, there are a few things that must be true in order for it to be called an invention. First, the invention must be novel and not already in use. Second, the invention must be useful, and third, the innovation must improve upon an existing product or method.
