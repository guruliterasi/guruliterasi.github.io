Implementation: How do you go about using new ideas to improve your business or organization?
When it comes to implementing new ideas, creativity is key. This is why businesses and organizations should take the time to brainstorm what they would like to accomplish with their new initiatives. After all, if a business does not have any clear goals or objectives, it will be difficult to put together a successful plan of action.
One way to come up with specific goals and objectives for your new initiative is by using a brainstorming tool. The most popular option for this is called Scrum, which stands for “Scenario Planning and Reworking in Construction”. This tool allows businesses and organizations to come up with specific goals that need to be accomplished in order for them to meet a certain deadline.

Another great way to come up with specific goals is by using SWOT analysis.

New models for innovation: How can new models for innovation be introduced into current practices to improve outcomes?
Innovation is an ever-evolving process that can improve outcomes by introducing new models and concepts into current practices. Several recent studies have shown that innovation can lead to increased success in terms of productivity, profitability, and customer satisfaction. However, there are some challenges that need to be overcome before innovation can be successful. One challenge is the fear of change, which can impede the development of new models and concepts. Another challenge is the lack of evidence that a model will work in practice, which can limit the impact of innovation. Finally, there is the need for regulatory support in order to ensure that innovations are brought to market successfully.

Origin of invention: Why was a particular invention chosen for development?
Inventions are often chosen for development based on a number of factors, including need, potential market, and other costs. There is an Origin of Invention story to be told every time a new invention is created. The story begins with the idea and then the process that went into making it a reality. 
Some inventions are born out of necessity; others come from pure thought. Sometimes, an idea just pops into someone's head and they start to see how it could be used in the real world. Other times, a team of experts put their thoughts together and come up with a great solution or innovation. 

The Origin of Invention story isn't always about bricks and mortar. Sometimes, ideas just take off in different directions after being studied and tested in various settings.
