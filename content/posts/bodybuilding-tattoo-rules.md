what is creativity?
What is creativity? It’s a question that has been asked throughout history, and one that still stumps us today. There are many definitions of creativity, but at its core, creativity is about generating new ideas.
It’s not just about coming up with crazy, out-of-the-box ideas (although that can be part of it). Creativity can also be about finding new ways to solve problems or approaching tasks in a different way.

So why is creativity important? For one, it’s essential for innovation. Without creativity, we wouldn’t have any new products, technologies or ideas. And in a world that’s constantly changing and evolving, we need to be able to adapt and come up with new solutions to keep up.

Creativity is also important for our mental health.

Small ideas can be very powerful, but when they're spread out thinly they're vulnerable to being killed by other ideas. That's where big ideas come in. By coming up with a large, overarching idea, you can fill in the gaps between the small ideas and create a more coherent plan. Big ideas are often more interesting, innovative, and exciting than smaller ones and can help your business take off.
