What is innovation?
Innovation is the creation of new ideas that replace or improve on the existing product, service, or system. Innovation can come from a small idea that’s implemented quickly, or it can come from a big idea that’s tackled in an effort to improve a whole product line. It can also come from the combination of two ideas, or from something new that isn’t even possible before.

How to make simple changes that can improve your home
Making simple changes to your home can improve its overall design, function and livability. Here are a few tips to get you started: 
1. Remove any obstacles from your way - remove any fliers, posters or other adornments that areinghamatairport-style wallpaper or carpets. You don't need them and they can add clutter and unsightliness. 
2. Make the living area more inviting - create a dividers wall between the bedroom and living room if you have one and make use of natural light instead of artificial light fixtures. This will help to create a more relaxing environment for spending time in your home. 
3. Add some storage - adding some storage boxes, cupboards or other containers on either end of the couch can seem like a small change, but it can make a big impact in how your home feels and looks.
