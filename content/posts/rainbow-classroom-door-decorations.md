Idea Generation: How do you generate new ideas?
Creative ideas are a dime a dozen, but thereâ€™s something about generating new ones that makes them stand out. If you can come up with an interesting and innovative idea, your next project will be much more successful. Here are 5 tips to help you generate fresh ideas:
1. Take a step back and think about what you want to achieve. When you come up with an original idea, itâ€™s important to focus on what the product or service could do for someone else. What problems could it solve? Who would be interested in using it?

2. Be persistent and keep exploring. Don't give up if your first suggested solution isn't perfect. Keep trying until you find the right combination of ideas and resources that work for you and your business.

3. Talk to people who use the product or service regularly.
