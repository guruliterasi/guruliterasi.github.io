Innovation is essential for businesses to survive and thrive in today’s ever-changing landscape. However, many organizations struggle with innovation because of various barriers. By understanding and overcoming these common obstacles, companies can create a culture of innovation that drives success.
One major barrier to innovation is fear of failure. Employees may be hesitant to suggest new ideas or take risks because they don’t want to be seen as failures.
