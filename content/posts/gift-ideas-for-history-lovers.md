What are the benefits of Blogging?
There are many benefits to blogging, including creating an online presence for your business, sharing your thoughts and ideas with others, and deepening the connection you have with your customers or followers. Here are four of the most popular benefits of blogging: 
1. Increased Visibility: When you start blogging, you become one of the “official” authors of your blog post. This gives other bloggers a higher chance of finding and reading your content, as well as potential customers who may be interested in what you have to say. 
2. Increased Exposure: Your blog posts will be seen by more people than if you wrote them all from scratch. Not only will this give you an audience that can potentially promote your brand or product, but it also leads to increased traffic and for website owners, more leads coming in from potential customers.

Big Data: How big data is changing the way businesses operate and what implications this has for everything from marketing to customer service.
Big data is now a big part of business operations. How this affects everything from marketing to customer service is a topic of debate. Some businesses see big data as a way to increase efficiency and make decisions faster, while others are concerned that it could have negative consequences. Here are four examples of how big data is changing the business landscape:
1) They're using big data to assess customer needs and then cater to them with tailored marketing campaigns. Previously, businesses conducted marketing research through questionnaire surveys or focus groups. With big data, businesses can now use machine learning algorithms to analyze huge amounts of information about customers in order to better understand their needs and preferences. This allows companies to identify what products or services are most popular and need improvement, which in turn can lead to new product development or even new sales campaigns.

Idea #3:
Ideas are the bedrock of any successful enterprise. Whether you're starting a business, developing a new product, or simply trying to solve a problem, having a great idea is the first step.
But what makes a great idea? And how can you come up with one? Here are three key tips:

1. Look for problems to solve. A great idea usually comes from solving a problem. So if you're looking for an idea, start by identifying problems that need solving. This could be something as simple as making your daily commute more efficient, or it could be something more complex like developing a new treatment for cancer.

2. Brainstorm with others. Sometimes the best ideas come from collaboration. If you're stuck, try brainstorming with friends, family, or colleagues.
