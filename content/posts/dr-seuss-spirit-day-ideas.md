Developing Your Idea: Once you have an idea, how do you develop it into a functional product?
If you have an invention idea, you may be wondering how to develop it into a functional product. The first step is to do some research and make sure your idea is unique. You can search online patent databases or contact a patent attorney to help you with this process.
Once you have determined that your idea is new and novel, the next step is to start developing it. This may involve creating a prototype or working with a manufacturer to produce a working model of your invention. The key is to keep moving forward and not get bogged down in the details.

With perseverance and a little luck, you can turn your invention idea into a reality. Just remember to take things one step at a time and always consult with experts when necessary.

History of Invention: How did inventions come about?
Invention comes about when a person or group of people come up with a new idea for something and then try to make it a reality. Some inventions, like the printing press and the Internet, were actually born out of necessity- like during World War II when people needed to create documents quickly. Other inventions, like the telephone and the electric chair, were made because someone was just curious or had an amazing idea and didn't want to give up that idea. There are so many different types of inventions, it's hard to choose just one as the history of invention is pretty amazing!
