Mindfulness: What are some ways that we can improve our overall health by implementing mindfulness into our lives?
Mindfulness is a way to improve our overall health by implementing it into our lives. Here are some ways to get started: 
1. Develop a meditation practice: Meditation can help improve your attention span and focus, which can lead to better mental health. Start with 10 minutes per day and grow as you feel comfortable with it. 
2. Take silent time for self-care: taking time for yourself in silence can be helpful in improving your overall wellbeing. Create calm and peaceful surroundings for yourself, and take 5-10 minutes each day to do something that makes you happy, connect with nature, or simply relax. 
3. Connect with others: One of the best things you can do for your mental health is connect with others who care about you.

In other cases, it can lead to over-zealous ideas and a lack of critical thinking skills.
