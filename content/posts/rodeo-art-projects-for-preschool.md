Causes of creative destruction: The creative process and its various variables
Creative destruction refers to the ability of new technologies, ideas, and processes to change the way businesses operate and create new opportunities. In today's economy, creative destruction is more than just a trend; it's a reality.
While there are many reasons behind creative destruction, one important factor is the ever-changing landscape of technology. As new devices and platforms arrive, old ways of doing business are no longer enough to keep up with the new competition. Businesses must adapt or perish.

One example of this is music streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. These services offer a unique way for listeners to access all types of music, from popular hits to obscure albums. While Spotify has been around for years and Apple Music was only released last year, both services have already made a name for themselves in the market.

This innovation is not limited to music either.

Invention as a process: How does one come up with new ideas?
One important step in the process of coming up with new ideas is to have a brainstorm. A brainstorming session is an opportunity for individuals to come up with new ideas without having to worry about whether or not they will be accepted. By using a brainstorming session, you can quickly and easily come up with new ideas that could potentially solve a problem. 
The best way to create a good brainstorming session is by creating a agenda beforehand and setting boundaries for who can participate. You should also make sure that everyone has something they are willing to share, so that everyone has an equal say in the discussion. It is important to do this because it will help free up energy and allow everyone to focus on their individual Ideas rather than worrying about how others might react. Once you have started the meeting, itâ€™s important to give everyone some time before taking any decisions.
