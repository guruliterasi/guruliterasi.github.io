Patenting: What is patenting?
Patenting inventions is a process of claiming property of a new invention, usually through issuance of a patent. The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) administers the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) system, which provides a single source for public information on the state of patent application and issue ceremonies. This information can be used to assess whether an invention merits protection and to create precedents for future claims against others.

Idea 3: A new type of battery
An inventor has come up with a new type of battery that could be used in many different applications. This battery, called an energy storage battery, could help people save power and money by storing energy rather than using it when it's needed. This would be a big change for the batteries we use today, and it could lead to more sustainable energy sources.
