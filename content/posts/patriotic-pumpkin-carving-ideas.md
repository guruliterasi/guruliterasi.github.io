The three Cs of creativity: Concept, Craft, and Color
Creativity is all about coming up with new and creative ways to approach a problem or achieve a goal. It can be found in everything from making art to designing costumes. In order for creativity to thrive, it needs two key components: concept and craft. Concept is the overall idea of what the piece will look like and how it will be used. Craft is the actual creation of the piece, from its conception to its completion. Finally, color is a critical factor in creating an effective work of art. By understanding these three components, creators can better focus on their creativity and produce pieces that are both unique and engaging.

Forms of inspiration: What are some ways to get inspired when you’re working on a project?
Creativity is key when it comes to any project. There are many ways that you can get inspired, and some are more effective than others. Here are a few examples: 
1. Take a walk in the park: This can be an excellent way to get your creative juices flowing. Depending on what type of park you choose, there may be different types of attractions to inspire you. For example, if you’re at the zoo, take a walk around the cages or go see the animals in their natural habitat. 
2. Draw something: This can be done in many ways, but often times there’s something specific that will come to mind when you start drawing or painting. Sometimes all you need is a piece of paper and some pen or pencils!
