What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first. 

Opportunity: What are the possible consequences of our actions? 

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?

Conclusion
In the past few years, the idea of a virtual reality headset has become more and more popular. Some people use it for gaming, others use it to watch movies or TV shows, but most people are just getting started with this technology. 
One of the newest features of virtual reality headsets is that they can be used to create 3D experiences. This is where you take your normal physical world and make it look like it's in a different place or dimension. It's a great way to explore new worlds without having to leave your home. 

There are some ways that virtual reality headsets can be used for education as well. For example, you could use them in class to help students learn about different cultures or worlds. You could also use them to help teach kids about life in other countries or worlds.
