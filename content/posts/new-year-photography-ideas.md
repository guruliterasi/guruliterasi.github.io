Causes and effects of innovation
Innovation is a key term in business. It can refer to any form of change that produces new products or services. But it’s particularly important when it comes to technology, which has the ability to quickly and easily change the way people live and work.
There are a number of causes and effects of innovation, but one of the most important is how it affects companies. Innovation can create new customer relationships, improve product quality, or reduce costs. In addition, innovation can help companies attract and retain talent, which can make them better able to compete in the global market.

But while innovation is an important factor in business success, there are also some key risks associated with it. For example, some companies may experience high levels of competition from rivals who are motivated by identical or even greater innovations.

Commercialization of an invention: What happens next?
Invention ideas are an important part of any business. They can be used to create new products or services, or to improve current ones. But what happens when these ideas are commercialized? In some cases, this can lead to great wealth for the inventor and their backers, while in others it can lead to negative consequences for the company or product. Here is a look at three examples:
1. Apple Inc.'s invention of the iPhone led toohlseaGapps (AIG) being created as a direct competitor, which in turn led to Apple getting greater profits and market share.

2. Microsoft's invention of the Windows operating system led to its rivals making versions that were more secure and easier to use than the original versions. This caused a decline in Redmond's market share and caused some criticism from users who felt they had not been given a fair chance.

Where to find them: Look around you
Invention ideas are everywhere. Look around your home, office, or neighborhood and you’ll find countless potential inventions just waiting to be created. Here are a few tips on where to find invention ideas:
Start by looking at everyday items and thinking about how they could be improved. For example, does your favorite coffee mug have a design flaw that makes it difficult to hold? Could your toothbrush be more ergonomic?

Pay attention to problems you encounter in your daily life. Is there an annoying task that you wish there was a machine to do for you? Is there a product that you can’t find that would make your life easier?

Keep a notebook with you and jot down any ideas that come to mind, no matter how small or silly they may seem. You never know when inspiration will strike!
