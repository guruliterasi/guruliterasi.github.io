Invention as a process: How does an inventor create a new product or idea?
Invention can be defined as the process of creating a new product or idea. Inventions result from the combined efforts of an inventor and their team. The team may include scientists, engineers, and designers. The goal of the team is to come up with a solution that meets the needs of the customer or user.
Invention is often a difficult process because it involves many steps and requires a lot of creativity. In order to create a successful invention, the inventor must have a clear idea of what they want to achieve and how they plan on achieving it. Without these plans, it is difficult to create a product that meets the needs of users.

The process of innovation
Innovation is a process that can be divided into four distinct stages: ideation, development, implementation, and diffusion.
Ideation is the stage in which new ideas are generated. This can involve brainstorming sessions, market research, or simply observing the world around you. Once an idea has been generated, it must be developed. This stage includes testing the feasibility of the idea and refining it until it is ready to be implemented.

Implementation is when the innovative idea is put into practice. This stage can be challenging, as it requires bringing the idea to life and making it work within the context of your business or organisation. Diffusion is the final stage of innovation, and refers to how widely the new idea is adopted. This stage is often influenced by factors such as marketing and word-of-mouth.
