Invention is the process of creating something new from something that already exists. Invention ideas can come from anything, from a simple idea to an innovative design. There are many different ways to come up with invention ideas, and each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are some examples: 
1. Inventor: This is the person who comes up with the original idea for the product or service. They may have been working on the same problem for a while and have come up with a better way to do it.
