Best ways to save on your energy bill:
Every day, we spend energy to do things that require electricity. Whether it’s turning on the lights or streaming Netflix, we use energy to do things. Now that electricity prices have been high for a while and there are more efficient ways to use power, it’s important to keep an eye on your energy bill and figure out what you can do to save money. Here are some tips: 
1. Turn off unnecessary lights – This is probably the easiest way to save on your energy bill. Just turn off all of the lights in your house when you’re not using them and then come back later when you want to turn them back on. This will save you about 20% on your monthly energy bill.
