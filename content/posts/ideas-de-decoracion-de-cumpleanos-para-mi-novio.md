Lessons learned from innovation: What have been some of the most successful implementations?
Innovation is a process of making something better. In technology, innovation often refers to the birth of new products or technologies, or the alteration of a design to make it more efficient, effective, or user-friendly. Innovation has been successful in many industries and sectors over the years, but there are some lessons that can be learned from some of the most successful implementations.
One such example is Google's Gmail, which was first introduced in 2000 and became wildly popular. The service allowed users to easily communicate with one another without having to leave their computers. It also became one of the first online services to offer free email storage for users. In addition, Gmail was originally designed as a way for small businesses to connect with larger companies and share files easier than ever before.

Conclusion: Some ways to come up with creative ideas.
Creative ideas are aplenty, but sometimes they don't come easy. You have to be willing to think outside the box and come up with new ways to do things. Here are some ways to come up with creative ideas: 
1. Take on a new project: This can be something as small as creating a new design for your business cards or as large as starting your own business. It doesn't have to be anything that you're exclusively good at – it could be something that you're curious about and haven't tried before. Everything counts! 
2. Lead an experiment: One of the best ways to come up with creative ideas is to lead an experiment. This means starting off by thinking about what you're not doing and trying something different instead.
