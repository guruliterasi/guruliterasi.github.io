Definition of innovation: How does innovation differ from traditional methods and technologies?
Innovation is a process of creating an new product, service or technology that is different from what has been done before. Innovation can bedefined as any change that makes something better or more efficient. Innovation can also bedefined as the ability to bring new ideas to market quickly and create value for customers. 
Traditional methods and technologies can also be called innovative, but they are not always the best options for how things are done. For example, a company might use a traditional way of doing marketing to get their product into peopleâ€™s hands sooner, but this approach might not be the best option when it comes to creating value for customers.
