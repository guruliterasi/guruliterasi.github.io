Ideas are a necessary part of any business or project. They can be used to come up with solutions to problems or to create new ideas. However, they can also be used for evil purposes. Some people use ideas as tools to manipulate others, while others use them as vehicles for their own creativity.

Invention ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but the key to a good one is creativity. With new technology constantly evolving, it can be hard to identify what makes an invention successful. But here are four tips for finding the right innovation:
