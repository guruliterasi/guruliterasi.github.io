what is innovation?
Innovation is a term used to describe the application of new ideas, methods or products. It includes both the process of creating new ideas and the implementation of those ideas into practice. Innovation is often used in business to refer to the process of introducing new products or services. However, it can also refer to improving existing products or services, as well as developing new processes or ways of doing things.
There are many different types of innovation, but all share a common goal: to create something new or improve upon something that already exists. The process of innovation typically begins with an idea. This can come from anywhere – an individual, a team, a company, or even a country. Once an idea has been generated, it must be developed and tested before it can be implemented. This process can take years, and sometimes even decades, to complete.

What obstacles do they present?
A new approach to energy storage is being developed with the goal of overcoming some of the major obstacles to its widespread implementation. One obstacle is the need for large, expensive batteries that can be used in stationary or home applications. Another obstacle is the difficulty in fabricating lithium-ion cells that can withstand repeated charges and discharge cycles. However, a team of researchers from Vanderbilt University has created a new battery design that overcome both challenges and could soon be available for use in devices such as cell phones and electric vehicles. The new battery uses nickel-cadmium (NMC) cells instead of lithium ion cells to store energy, which makes it more environmentally friendly and cheaper to produce. The team's findings are published in an upcoming issue of Science Advances.
