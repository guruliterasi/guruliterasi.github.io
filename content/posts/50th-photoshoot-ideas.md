Ideation: How do you come up with new ideas for DIY projects?
Ideation is a process of coming up with new ideas for DIY projects. The key to success in ideation is taking your time and brainstorming multiple options. When you have a good idea, it's important to follow through with it. Here are a few tips on how to come up with new ideas:
1. Take your time – One of the best ways to come up with new ideas for DIY projects is to take your time. Don't go too fast or too slow; just be patient and allow yourself plenty of time to think about everything you've been thinking about lately.

2. Be open to variety – Some people prefer one style of project over another, while others may be more interested in multiple styles or colors together. Just because something appears simple on the outside doesn't mean it has to be that way on the inside!
