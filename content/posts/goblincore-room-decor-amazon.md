What are some invention ideas?
There are many invention ideas out there, and it can be hard to know which ones to pursue. Here are a few tips to help you make the best choices:
1. Look at what others have done before you. If you're looking for an idea that's already been done, take a look at existing patents, copyrights, or other sources of inspiration.

2. Consider your target market. What is your target market? Are you looking for a specific audience or market? This will help you determine which invention ideas might be most successful for you.

3. Try multiple methods of experimentation. You don't have to duplicate everything that someone else has done before you; instead, try different methods of experimentation and see which ones work best for you.

4. Get feedback from people who know your target market well.

Brainstorming with a team
1. When it comes to brainstorming with a team, there are a few things to keep in mind.
2. First and foremost, itâ€™s important to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas. This means no judgement or criticism â€“ just open-mindedness and respect for othersâ€™ opinions.

4. Finally, donâ€™t forget the power of visual aids! If you can find a way to visualize your teamâ€™s ideas, it will help everyone to better understand and remember them later on.
