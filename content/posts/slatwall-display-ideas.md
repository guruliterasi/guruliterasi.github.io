Nature has always been a source of inspiration for new inventions. People have come up with new ways to do things based on natural phenomena for centuries.

What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but they must be good ideas in order to be successful. Good ideas should be inspired by something that someone else has done or is doing, and they should be forward-thinking in nature. In order to come up with the best ideas, it's important to have a clear vision for what you want your business to achieve. It's also important to have a plan for how you will get there. Finally, it's essential to have the courage to take risks and not afraid of failure. These three key factors are essential when coming up with big ideas.
