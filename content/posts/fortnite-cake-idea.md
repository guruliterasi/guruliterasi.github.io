Conclusion: What is invention? How important is it? Why has it been so important in human history?
Invention has been a key part of human history for as long as humans have been able to write and ideas have been able to spread. Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or solution, which can be used to improve something that someone else has created. Inventions have helped people achieve success in a variety of fields, from technology to medicine. In recent years, however, invention has come under fire from some who argue that it is an important part of plagiarism and creativity.

Conclusion: How to come up with big ideas and what they mean for your business or project.
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that always apply: think outside the box, brainstorm, and be flexible. With that in mind, here are five tips on how to come up with big ideas for your business or project: 
1. Start by thinking about what you want your business or project to achieve. What problems do you want to solve? What goals do you want to achieve? This will give you a good starting point for brainstorming ideas. 
2. Be open to other suggestions. When you’re brainstorming, don’t be afraid to take other people’s suggestions into account. If someone has an idea that sounds great but doesn’t quite fit your project, don’t be afraid to change it up a bit – after all, this is brainstorming!
