What is an invention?
There is no one definitive definition of an invention, but most Americans would likely say that an invention is a new product, process, or service.  Inventors often work on their inventions for years before they finally create a product or service that people can use. 
There are many different types of inventions, but some common ones include technological advances like the Telephone, Telegraph and Radio Act of 1847 (TCR), which gave us the ability to talk to each other over the air; and health advances such as aspirin and insulin in the 1800s. 

Inventions can have a profound impact on society and the economy. For example, TCR allowed for easier travel and communication across country boundaries. This made it possible for people from all corners of the world to meet and share ideas. Similarly, insulin helped people with diabetes control their medications more effectively.

Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at old things to new ways of doing the same thing, but they always have to have a purpose. In the world of creative ideas, there are endless possibilities, but sometimes the best ones just don't work out. That's why it's important to have a clear idea of what you want your creative project to achieve. If you can't specify what you want it to achieve, your project might not be successful.
