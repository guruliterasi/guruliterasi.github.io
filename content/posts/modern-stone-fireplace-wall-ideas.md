The role of innovation in business:
Innovation is essential to businesses in today's competitive environment. By constantly developing new products and services, businesses can stay ahead of the curve and remain competitive. However, there are a few key challenges that must be overcome in order for businesses to continue to innovate:1) It can be difficult to predict what will work and what won't in the market; 2) Some ideas may not be viable based on the company's current resources or past experience; 3) The novelty of a new product may wear off after a short period of time; 4) There may be some initial costs associated with innovation which can impact business margins; 5) Innovation often requires time and effort - particularly during the early stages of development; 6) Some aspects of innovation, such as customer service, may not match traditional expectations.

Defining Innovation
Innovation is a term that is used frequently but its meaning can be difficult to define. When asked to define innovation, most people will give a general and vague answer. The true definition of innovation is much more specific.
Innovation can be defined as the process of taking an idea or concept and turning it into a reality. It is the implementation of a new or improved solution that solves a problem or meets a need. Innovation involves creativity, but it also requires resourcefulness, planning, and execution.

There are many different types of innovation, but all share one common goal: to make something better. Whether itâ€™s a new product, process, or service, innovation strives to improve upon what already exists. Sometimes this means coming up with an entirely new solution, and other times it means making small improvements to existing solutions.
