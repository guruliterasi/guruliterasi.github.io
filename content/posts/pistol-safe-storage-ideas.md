The benefits of big ideas: What are they, and why should we care?
Big ideas are the lifeblood of innovation. They can change the world, and sometimes all it takes is a great idea to get started. Here are three reasons why big ideas should be of utmost importance to businesses and individual citizens alike: 
1) Big ideas can inspire new thinking and creativity. When a business or individual sees something that they believe could have a profound impact, they often come up with new business models or theories to pursue those ideas. 

2) Big ideas can build communities of support. No one invention or discovery is ever complete; rather, every step in the development of big ideas brings us closer to becoming one cohesive unit. This sense of community also makes it easier for individuals to raise money and create products/services that have a real impact on society as a whole. 

3) Big ideas may help solve pressing global problems.

Protectionism: How has protectionism affected invention propagation?
Protectionism has had a significant impact on the propagation of invention ideas. Invention ideas often originate from a new perspective or idea that is not protected by current legislation. Protectionism can stop these new perspectives from reaching a wider audience, and it can also limit the number of products that can be created based on an idea.
