In 2020, many people are likely to believe that the future of work is one where machines take over most tasks. This is due to the mounting evidence that artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more advanced, and will soon be able to outperform humans in many tasks. With so much automation happening, it's no wonder that companies are looking for ways to keep employees on board with the idea of AI taking over work.
