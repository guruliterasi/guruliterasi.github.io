The downside of having invention ideas: They take time and effort
Invention ideas are a dime a dozen. But turning an invention idea into a reality takes time, money and effort.
Many would-be inventors never take the first step because they don't know where to start or they are afraid of failure.

There is no guarantee that your invention will be a success. In fact, most inventions never make it to market. Even if your invention is successful, you may not see any financial return on your investment for years, if at all.

The Idea: 1. What are some big ideas?
There are a few big ideas out there when it comes to starting a business. Here are some of the most prominent:
1. Start small and grow large. This is one of the most important things to remember when starting a business. You don't have to be the biggest or best in the world just start something and see where it takes you.
2. Be passionate about what you do. If you're not passionate about your work, no one else will be either. This is something that will come with time and experience, but start off by putting your all into your startup and showing people that you're really into it.
3. Have repeat customers/clients come back for more.

The different types of creative art
There are many different types of creative art. The most common are painting, sculpture, photography, and architecture. However, there are many other forms of creative art, such as pottery, jewelry making, and quilting.
Each type of creative art has its own unique characteristics. For example, painting is a two-dimensional form of art that uses color to create images on a canvas. Sculpture is a three-dimensional form of art that uses various materials to create statues or other objects. Photography is a two-dimensional form of art that captures images using a camera. Architecture is the art and science of designing and constructing buildings.

Different types of creative art appeal to different people. Some people enjoy the challenge of creating something from nothing, while others prefer the satisfaction of taking an existing object and making it their own.
