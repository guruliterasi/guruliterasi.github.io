The term "brainstroming" has been around for quite some time, but it wasn't until 2006 that the term was coined to describe the phenomenon of individuals being overwhelmed by a single task or idea. The name comes from a phrase used by Eisenhower in his Farewell Address in 1961, where he spoke about the "massive national effort" which was needed to meet the challenges of the future.
