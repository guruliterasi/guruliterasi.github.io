The role of creativity in art: What does it mean for the artist?
Creativity has been in the eye of the beholder since Antiquity. Whether it be in painting, architecture or music, creativity is what makes art. However, what does creativity actually mean for an artist? In classical times, creativity was considered to be a gift from God. Today, we understand that creativity is something that can be developed through practice and practice can take many different forms. For example, a musician may learn how to play an instrument and then use that knowledge to create new music. An artist may learn how to paint and then use their creative skills to create works of art. While there is no set definition for creativity, most agree that it includes the ability to see things differently than others and to come up with new ideas. In other words, creativity is a state of being where one's thoughts and feelings drive their actions.
