Eco-Friendly Home Improvements: How can you make your home more eco-friendly?
Eco-friendly home improvements are easy to make if you take the time to think about what you need and want. Here are a few ideas to help make your home more eco-friendly:
1. Make sure your heating and cooling system is eco-friendly. Not only will this save you money in the long run, but it can also help improve your environment by reducing emissions from your home.

2. Use recycled materials in your construction. When building or repairing your home, be sure to use recycled materials whenever possible. This not only saves you money in the long run, but it also helps reduce environmental impact on both of our planet’s inhabitants and future generations.

3. Use rainwater tanks rather than water systems that use water fluoridation products.

Style: How to write effectively?
It is easy to become bogged down in the details of writing style when you're just starting out. However, by following a few simple tips, you can improve your writing style and make your work more effective. Here are five tips:
1. Use active voice
When you write, use active voice to describe what's happening in the story. This will make the reader feel like they are on the scene, rather than reading a report from someone else.

2. Use clear and concise language
 clarity is key when it comes to writing. Make sure your words are easy to read and understand. And don't forget to use proper grammar!

3. Use concrete examples    When you're talking about something specific, use concrete examples instead of jargon or metaphors. This will help readers see what you're trying to say in a clear way.
