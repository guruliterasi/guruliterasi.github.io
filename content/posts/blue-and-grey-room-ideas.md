Types of innovation
Innovation comes in many different forms, and it is one of the most important aspects of any business. There are three main types of innovation: product, process, and business model.
Product innovation is all about creating new products or improving existing ones. This can be anything from coming up with a new invention to making small changes to an existing product. Process innovation is all about improving the way that products are made, such as introducing new methods or technologies. Business model innovation is all about changing the way that businesses operate, such as introducing new business models or ways of selling products.

Each type of innovation has its own benefits and challenges. Product innovation can lead to new revenue streams, but it can also be risky and expensive. Process innovation can improve efficiency and quality, but it can also be disruptive to existing operations.
