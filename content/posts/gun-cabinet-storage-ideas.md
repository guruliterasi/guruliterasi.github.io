How to get great ideas: Take time to think productively, don't rely on external sources, and be open to feedback.
If you're like most people, you go through the motions of thinking productively but don't really get out there and generate new ideas. You might rely on external sources to get your creative juices flowing, or you may be afraid to give feedback because it could mean you're not working in the right direction. If you take the time to think productively, though, all of those assumptions and inhibitions fall away. You can also be open to feedback – even if it's a little bit challenging – because it will help you become better at generating new ideas.

Conclusion: What are some things to keep in mind when trying to achieve creative goals?
Creative goals can be anything from making a beautiful piece of art to designing a new product. There are several things to keep in mind when trying to achieve creative goals. One important thing to keep in mind is that you should always aim for the best possible outcome. If you do not care about the end result, then your creativity will likely not be productive. Another important thing to consider when trying to achieve creative goals is how you plan on achieving them. Do not try to accomplish too many things at once, as this will likely lead to frustration and further planning problems. Lastly, do not forget that creativity does not have to come from inside yourself – it can also come from outside sources. When looking for inspiration, look for stories or articles that might help jog your memory and create new ideas.
