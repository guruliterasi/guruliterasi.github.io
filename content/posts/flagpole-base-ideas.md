What’s in store for the future of technology?
This year, many articles and presentations were made about the future of technology. The topics ranged from the digital age to artificial intelligence and beyond. However, one thing that was conspicuously absent was any discussion on how technology could impact our social lives. 
It seems that many people are still quite unsure of how technology will have an impact on our daily lives. Some believe that it will only be a force for good, while others remain worried about its ability to divide us further along lines of gender, race, and economic status. Some may even see it as a harbinger of great evil - like in the case of AI becoming self-aware and exploiting humans for their own gain. But whatever the future holds, one thing is for sure: tech will have an important role to play.

How to Choose the Right Tools for Your DIY Projects:
There are a number of factors you need to consider when choosing the right tools for your DIY projects. Here are four tips to help you make the best decision:
1. What you need: You should have a basic understanding of how tools work before beginning any project. If you don't know what you're using, it's hard to be successful. choose the right tool for the job and don't overspend on something you can't use or don't need.

2. The size of the project: smaller tasks may require smaller tools, while bigger projects may require larger tools. Make sure to get a tool that is appropriate for your needs and your skill level.

3. The type of project: Some projects are better suited for one-time use, while others may require more expertise or experience than what is available at home.

Invention is the process of coming up with a new product or idea. It can be something as simple as a new way to make a product, or something more complex like creating a machine that does what another does not exist. Invention can be a lot of fun and it can help us create things that we never thought possible.
