Other Ideas: How do you go about thinking of other creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to improve the process of thinking. Here are a few tips on how to consider other creative ideas:
1. Look at your current work and ask yourself what you can improve. What are the areas that need improvement? How can you make those improvements?
2. Brainstorm with a group of people. When you come up with new ideas, it can be helpful to have others involved. Why not group together and brainstorm some potential solutions to problems you're currently facing? This will help you to formulate new ideas more effectively.
3. Take a step back and think about your goals. Once you've identified some areas that need improvement, what do you want to achieve with your change? What kind of results do you envision for your new efforts?

Impact of innovation on society and economy:
Innovation is an ever-growing movement in the economy that leads to new products, services and businesses. It is also a key factor in society; innovations often lead to changes in social norms and the way people interact. The impact of innovation on society and economy has been studied for many years and there are some clear conclusions about what types of innovation have the biggest impact. 
One clear conclusion is that innovative activity can have a significant positive impact on society if it meets three conditions: it should be done in a way that does not harm others, it should be affordable for everyone, and it should be able to create jobs. However, even when innovations meet these conditions, they can still have a negative impact on society if they do not meet other specific requirements.
