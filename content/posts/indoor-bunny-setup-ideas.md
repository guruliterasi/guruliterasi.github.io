What is innovation?
Innovation is the creation of new ideas that replace or improve on the existing product, service, or system. Innovation can come from a small idea that’s implemented quickly, or it can come from a big idea that’s tackled in an effort to improve a whole product line. It can also come from the combination of two ideas, or from something new that isn’t even possible before. Innovation is something that every company needs to consider when they create their products and services.

The definition of creativity: What does it mean for artists?
Creativity is often misunderstood and its definition can be difficult to determine. Some say creativity refers to the ability to come up with new ideas, while others define creativity as the ability to see things in a different way or express oneself through art. There are many definitions for creativity, but one that stands out is the idea that creativity is important for artists because it allows them to express themselves in a unique way. This is why creativity has been seen as such an important asset for many individuals, businesses, and countries over the years.

The benefits of big thinking
If you want to change the world, you have to start by thinking big. That’s the premise behind big thinking: the belief that we can solve problems and create opportunities by coming up with large-scale solutions.
