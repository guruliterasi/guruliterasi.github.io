How to get started with big ideas?
If you're looking to start making big ideas, one of the best ways to do it is by learning how to brainstorm. A lot can be gained from practicing brainstorming, especially if you want to come up with ideas for projects or products that are both new and innovative. Here are a few tips on how to get started: 
1. Make a list of key ideas 
This is probably the most important step in brainstorming, as it will help you determine which ones you should keep in mind for further consideration. Once you have a few key ideas, it's time to begin working on developing them into full-blown concepts. 
2. Take some time for yourself 
When brainstorming, it's important not to spend too much time just thinking about what other people might think or feel about your idea.

Conclusion: What does all this mean for artists today?
In the past few decades, creativity has become an increasingly popular word in the art world. This is mainly due to the rise of digital technology and its ability to allow for more creative expression.Today, artists have more opportunities than ever to express themselves through their work. However, there are some potential consequences of this newfound freedom that need to be considered.
One potential consequence is that people may no longer view artists as important or valuable members of society. This could lead to a decrease in patronage and investment from businesses and organizations that rely on creativity in their products or services. Additionally, it could prevent young people from learning about and learning from art as a form ofexpression.

Even though these consequences may be minor in comparison to other matters, they should be taken into account when making decisions about how best to support creative art today.
