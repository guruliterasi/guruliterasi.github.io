What are the challenges of having big ideas?
There are a few key challenges that come with having big ideas, according to Jason Fried. Fried is the author of The Lean Startup, a book on how to build successful startups. In his book, he discusses how it can be tough to stay creative and keep up with new ideas when your mind is constantly filled with too many thoughts. 
One challenge is that it can be hard to remember what you just thought of. Another is that it can be difficult to get your thoughts down in writing form. Finally, Fried says that it can be hard to see the big picture when you're thinking about individual products or services.

What are the benefits of having ideas?
When it comes to ideas, there are many benefits to having them. Ideas can help solve problems, provide new perspectives, and even change the course of history. Here are five ways in which ideas can benefit individuals and organizations: 
1. Ideas can help people think differently. When people have different ideas about a problem or issue, they can come up with more solutions than if they were just following the same path. By sharing their own perspectives and thoughts, people can form better plans and strategies for solving problems. 
2. Ideas can help organizations grow. One of the best things about having ideas is that they give organizations a range of options for new products, services, or directions. This allows businesses to explore different paths and figure out what works best for them while also staying afloat in a changing market landscape.

Requirements for innovation
Innovation is essential to the success of businesses and societies. However, some challenges companies face when it comes to innovation include:
-Lack of creativity: Many companies find it difficult to come up with new ideas. This is due in part to the rigid methods that are typically used in business. For example, most businesses have a traditional model where products are produced one after the other. This system limits the potential for creativity and producesfewer new ideas.

-Disruption: When a new idea comes along, many companies are hesitant to adopt it because they think it would be too expensive or hard to replicate. However, disruption is often what allows businesses to take risks and innovate new models.
