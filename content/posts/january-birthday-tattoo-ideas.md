Origins of creativity: How has creativity emerged over time, and what reasons do we have for expecting it to continue to grow?
Creativity has been around for a while, and there are several reasons why we think it will continue to grow. One reason is that creativity is oftenasured in terms of what can be done, rather than what is possible. For example, in architecture, the goal is to create something beautiful and unique, not to solve a problem. This focus on beauty means that architects can often come up with really creative ideas that don't solve any problems. Another reason why creativity will continue to grow is because humans are constantly learning. We constantly learn new things and try new things, so our minds are constantly evolving and growing more creative.

The future of energy: How will we get enough energy?
In the coming years, there are a number of ideas that could help solve the energy crisis we are currently experiencing. One idea is to add more wind and solar power to our grids, which would help us get more energy from the sun and wind. Another idea is to reduce the use of gasoline and diesel fuel, which would save us money in the long run. And finally, we could also look at ways to create more efficient appliances and vehicles, which would help us conserve energy.

Creative people are often misunderstood. They may not be considered “art” people or “design” people, but they have a lot of energy and ideas that can often lead to great things. Creative people are often difficult to pigeonhole, and no one knows what they’re working on until it’s finished.

What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but it's not just about ideas. It's about how you develop and pursue them that makes them truly good. Here are three tips to help you make great big ideas:
1. Do your research 
Before any big idea has a chance to grow, it's important to do your research. By understanding the industry, the competition, and what people are using or thinking of, you can create a better idea that is Tacoma-specific and relevant to your area. 
2. Be persistent 
With a good idea in mind, don't be discouraged if it doesn't quite hit home at first. Keep pushing yourself and see where things take you. Once you have a solid concept and market segmentation, you can start working on developing those details (marketing strategy, product design, etc).
