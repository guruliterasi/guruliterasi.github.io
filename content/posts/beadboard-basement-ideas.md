The Benefits of New Ideas: What do they offer?
The benefits of new ideas are vast and range from more efficient ways to do things to new and innovative products that can change the way people live. Here are a few examples: 
1. New ideas can help you save time and money. If you can think of a way to make your work or home easier, you may be able to save time and money on tasks that you previously would have had to spend hours completing. 
2. New ideas can improve your creativity. When you come up with new ideas, it can be difficult not to come up with something that is both good and useful. By taking some time for yourself to come up with new ideas, you will be more likely to find something onerous or simply useless as well as something valuable that you could implement into your life immediately. 
3. New ideas can make life easier.

The computer: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, American inventors Charles Babbage and Herman Hollerith created the first mechanical computers. These early machines were complex and expensive, and they could only be used by trained mathematicians and engineers. In 1937, British mathematician Alan Turing published a paper that described how a machine could be built to perform any type of calculation. Turing's paper inspired many scientists and engineers to begin work on electronic computers. In 1941, German engineer Konrad Zuse designed and built the first programmable computer. The first computers were large, expensive, and used vacuum tubes for circuitry.
