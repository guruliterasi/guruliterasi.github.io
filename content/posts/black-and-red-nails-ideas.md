In 2022, many believe that the United States should consider a new immigration policy that prioritized people who can contribute to society. Ideas for this policy could include increasing the number of refugees who are allowed into the country, increasing the number of visas available for skilled immigrants, and lowering the waiting times for citizenship. Another idea is to have a more open exchange market between the US and other countries, which would create jobs and increase wages.
