What are some 2020 ideas?
2020 is a year of opportunity. It's a time to think about what we can do to make our world a better place. Here are two ideas that could help: 
The first is the United Nations' " Agenda 21 ," which calls for creating an international body to focus on sustainable development. This would be a great way to bring together different groups of people who have something to say about how the world should be run, and it would also be a good way to learn from other countries. 
The second is the Global Compact on climate change, which was started in 2014 by more than 190 countries. The idea behind it is that all countries must take steps to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or less. This would mean reducing emissions from industries and buildings, improving energy efficiency, and investing in renewable energy sources.
