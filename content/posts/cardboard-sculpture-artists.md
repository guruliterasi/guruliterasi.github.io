Tips for using creative ideas: How can you use your creativity to your advantage?
Creative ideas are a great way to come up with new and innovative ways to solve problems or create new products. However, there are a few things you can do to make sure that your creative ideas are successful:
1) Make sure that your ideas are original. Don’t steal other people’s ideas, or use old ideas without giving them a fresh start.
