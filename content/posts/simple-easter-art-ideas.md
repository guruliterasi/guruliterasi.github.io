Futures of technology
What do you think the future holds for technology? Some believe that it will continue to evolve and grow, while others predict that it will become more advanced and complex. Either way, there are a number of ideas that could be explored in order to further advance this field. Here are some possible scenarios:
1) In 2022, we may see advances in 3D printing technology that allow for objects to be created from multiple layers of plastic or other materials. This would allow for a significant increase in the number of products that can be manufactured on a large scale, as well as faster and easier production times.

2) Another development that could impact our industry is the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). As machines get better at learning and responding to various challenges, they may become capable of performing tasks that were once considered impossible or too difficult for humans to perform.

The future of education: What will be the biggest changes in education in 2022?
The future of education is shrouded in many potential changes. One of the most important changes will be the way we educate our students. In 2022, there are many ideas that could impact education in a major way. Some of these ideas include: 
1) Increased emphasis on video gaming and physical activity to improve learning: Video gaming has become increasingly popular in recent years, and this trend is likely to continue. This can help children learn more quickly and efficiently, as they can get lost in the game and not have to worry about homework or other school tasks. Physical activity also has great effects on learning. Children who spend more time active have better mental health, better grades, and less anxiety. 

2) Changes to how schools are run: Many schools are currently run like businesses.
