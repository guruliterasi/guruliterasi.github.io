Cultural aspects of Invention: How do people React to Innovation?
When someone comes up with a new invention, people often react in different ways. Some people may be excited by the idea, while others may be skeptical. Still others may just be curious. Different reactions mean that different people have different perspectives on innovation. 
One example of how people react to innovation is through patenting. Patenting an invention means that somebody has made something that is exclusive to them and can't be copied or used by anyone else. This can help protect the inventor's work from being copied or used without permission. 

Another example of how people react to innovation is through creativity. When somebody comes up with a new idea, they may be inspired by it or they might not be. It all depends on the person and their perspective on innovation.

Invention can come from anyone, but it’s often most fruitful when it occurs in collaboration between two people. When something novel and new is created by two people, the potential for innovation is limitless.

Creative work can be divided into two categories: original and derivative. Original work is created from scratch while derivative work is a remake or adaptation of something else.
Creative work can be divided into two categories according to how it is created: original and derivative. Original work, or creation from scratch, is typically more creative and usually lasts for longer periods of time. Derivative work, or a remake or copycat, is typically much less creative and often shorter in duration.
