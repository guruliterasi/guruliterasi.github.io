Different types of innovation:
Innovation is a key term in business. It can be defined as the process of making something new and better. There are many types of innovation, some of which are more common than others. 
One type of innovation is product innovation. This refers to the development of a new product that does not already exist. In this case, the company must come up with a new way to make their product and market it to customers. 

Another type of innovation is process innovation. This occurs when companies improve the way they do something, such as developing a new manufacturing process or changing how they distribute products. Process innovations can have a big impact on the efficiency and profitability of businesses. 

Finally, there is service innovation. This refers to the development of new services that could not be produced by companies alone, such as software development or customer service.
