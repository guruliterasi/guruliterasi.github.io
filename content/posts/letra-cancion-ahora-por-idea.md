Definition of Innovation: How does it differ from other types of innovation?
Innovation is the process of change in a product or service. It can be defined as a new way of doing something, or an alteration in the way that something is done. Innovation can come from people or businesses, and it can happen in a number of different ways. 
One common definition of innovation is "the use of new ideas, methods and approaches to solve problems." This definition includes many different aspects to innovation, including business models, product design, marketing strategy and even customer service. It's important to note that innovation doesn't have to happen only in the context of business; it can also occur within individual teams or startups. 

The most distinguishing feature of innovation is its impact on society. Innovation can mean different things for different industries, but one thing that's always included is the idea of creating value for others.

How to come up with great big ideas
Big ideas can be a really fun way to get your creative juices flowing. Here are some tips on how to come up with great big ideas. 
1. Get organized: When you have a lot of ideas, it can be hard to decide which ones to work on. One way to make this process easier is to create a list of main points or topics that you want to cover. From there, you can break each one down into smaller pieces and start working on those that seem the most interesting and important. 

2. Be open to change: It’s rare that something will stay the same for very long in life. Sometimes what seemed like an easy idea at first might not be as difficult as we thought it would be after further thought. This is where being open to change comes in handy.
