There are many ways to try and solve the problem, but none of them seem to be working. There are several possible solutions, but they all have their own set of challenges. One potential solution is to invest in ideas more, but this can be difficult to do given the current climate.

Creative processes: How do you go about coming up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas can come in any form, whether it’s coming up with a new product, idea for a new show, or even just a new way to look at something. Whether you want to come up with something original or simply reuse an existing idea, there are some key processes that you need to follow when coming up with creative ideas.

This could mean looking at different concepts and seeing which ones appeal to you the most, or exploring other possibilities and seeing which ones work best for your project.
