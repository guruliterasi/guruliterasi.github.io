Differences between creative visual and auditory artists: Visual artists typically paint or sculpt while auditory artists listen to music or read books. Kinesthetic artists may use their body to create works of art. Gustatory artists may choose flavors or smells to add
Visual artists typically paint or sculpt while auditory artists listen to music or read book. While the two mediums have certain similarities, there are also significant differences that can make a difference in the way an artist creates their work. For example, visual artists often use colors and shapes to create patterns and images while auditory artists often listen to music or read books as sources of inspiration. Additionally, visual artists may use more abstract techniques while auditory artists may prefer more realistic portrayals of their subjects. While these differences may seem minor, they can make a huge impact in the way an artist completes their work.

The power of creativity: What does it mean to be creative?
Creativity is a state of mind, it's ability to think outside the box and come up with new ideas. People who are creative often have an idea for something that they don't know how to do but they get stuck on how to make it a reality. One reason creativity is so important is because without creativity, there would be no innovation in the world. It can be difficult to be creative at times, but with practice you can become one of the most creative people around.
