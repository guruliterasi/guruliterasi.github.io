What are the benefits of big ideas?
Big ideas can be a great way to get your creative juices flowing and help you come up with new ideas. There are a number of benefits to big ideas, including increase productivity, increased creativity, and more efficient thinking. Here are four examples:
1. Big ideas can lead to new solutions to old problems. When you have a big idea, you can start by thinking about what other people have already tried and found successful. This will give you new insights that could solve the problem at hand.

2. Big ideas can free up time for you to focus on your own work instead of others’ work. When you have a lot of big ideas in your head, it can be difficult to focus on your own projects. Instead of struggling with each one, working on a few big ones will free up time for you to achieve the rest of your goals.

Invention: How has innovation changed over time?
Invention has been a key feature of human history. From the development of tools and weapons to the invention of new transportation methods, innovation has always been a part of human culture. However, over time, innovation has become more complex and dynamic. Innovation can be described as the process by which new ideas, technologies, or business models are created. It encompasses everything from developing new products to creating new ways of doing business.
One example of this evolution is the development of technology. Technology has constantly changed over time and has helped increase efficiency in many industries. For example, airplane travel was originally difficult and expensive to achieve, but with the development of airplanes, people could now travel all over the world easily. The same can be said for computer programs and other technological developments. By changing how we use these technologies, we have increased their efficiencies and made them more available to everyone.

What are some bad ideas?
New ideas can be a good thing, or a bad thing depending on how they're executed. Here are some bad ideas that could lead to negative outcomes: 
1. A new law that restricts freedom of speech. This law could lead to people being arrested and/or fined for expressing their opinions out of fear of retribution from the government. 
2. A plan to close all schools in the city in order to provide more public education. This plan would deprive children of instruction and would lead to an increase in crime rates in the city. 
3. Requiring businesses owners to install security cameras inside their businesses in order to catch thieves and criminals. This would require owners to spend money on something that isn't necessary and would also create an inconvenience for customers who need access to their businesses without having their business broken into.
