Creative process: how does creativity happen?
Creativity happens in a many ways, but one of the most common is through the creative process. This process starts with idea generation, which can be both mental and physical. Once an idea has been generated, it needs to be defended and considered. Once it's considered, it needs to be put into practice in order to see if it's a good idea or not. There are different steps that need to be followed in order for an idea to become a reality, but the most important part is that the creative team is together and working towards a common goal.

The first invention: fire
Invention is often thought of as something that comes about as a result of human intelligence and creativity. However, the first invention was not created by humans at all – it was fire.
Before the advent of fire, life on Earth was very different. The planet was much colder and darkness ruled the night. But then, somewhere in the distant past, a lightning strike or a volcanic eruption set a tree ablaze. And from that fateful event, fire was born.

For early humans, fire must have been both a boon and a bane. On the one hand, it provided warmth and light; on the other hand, it could also be deadly if not controlled properly. But over time, we learned to harness fire and use it to our advantage. Today, fire is an integral part of human life – from cooking our food to powering our industries.
