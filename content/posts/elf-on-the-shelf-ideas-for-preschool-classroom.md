The history of innovation: From the Greeks to the Silicon Valley
Innovation has a long and storied history, which can be traced back to the Greeks. They were the first to conceive of the modern industrial revolution, which is often credited with invalidating feudalism. In addition, they also invented hydraulics and pneumatics, among other sciences.

In 1969, Steve Jobs founded Apple Inc., which became one of the world’s most innovative companies. Since then, Jobs and his team have developed iconic products like the iPhone and iPad.
